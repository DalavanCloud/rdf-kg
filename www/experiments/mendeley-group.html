           "abstract": "The term facilitation generally describes positive interactions between plants, and a common approach in these studies is to identify a dominant plant to structure sampling. Unfortunately, whilst this field has rapidly expanded commun- ity ecology, it rarely includes other trophic levels such as insects and pollinators. Here, we combine facilitation, pollination, and reciprocity measures to explore the general hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in a benefactor plant species mediates its impact. The following three predictions were tested and supported using the gynodioecious alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis (L.) Jacq.: (i) that the trait set of a gynodioecious benefactor plant varies between genders; (ii) that dimorphism changes the facilitation of other plants, arthropods, and pollinators; and (iii) that insect selectivity, particularly pollinators, reciprocally impacts the reproductive output of the two genders. Female S. acaulis cushion plants produced significantly more flowers but they were smaller than those of hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodite cushions facilitated other plant species and pollinators more effectively than females, whilst females strongly facilitated more arthropods. Finally, female plants have significantly higher reproductive output as estimated by fruit and seed production, and this was directly related to visi- tation rate by pollinators. Hence, this study clearly establishes the value of combining some of the common themes of polli- nation biology such as sexual dimorphism, floral morphology, and measuring reproduction with the study of positive plant– plant interactions."

           "abstract": "In general, invasive plants are assumed to behave more aggressively in their invasive ranges than in their native range, and studies of the mechanisms of invasion often assume these differences. However, comparisons of abundances between native and invasive ranges are rarely carried out. We compared density and dispersion of the invasive plant, Centaurea melitensis (Asteraceae) in its native range and two invasive ranges of similar mediterranean-climate type. The objective was to quantify the differences in its abundance among three distant regions. We surveyed six sites in the native range (Spain) and in each of two invaded ranges (California and central Chile) for population density, relative dominance and spatial distribution of Centaurea. Centaurea occurred at higher densities in invasive sites than in native ones, with a median of 100 plants per m2 and 70 plants per m2 in California and Chile, respectively, compared to only 4 plants per m2 in Spain. Centaurea was more dominant in both invasive ranges than in the native range. Centaurea density and relative dominance were highly variable within regions. Plants in Spain were randomly dispersed, while those in both invasive ranges were more aggregated. Annual precipitation and mean annual temperature were the best predictors of Centaurea density. In California sites, density was negatively correlated with soil nutrients. The presence of at least one high-density population with near total dominance in Spain suggests that there might be ecological mechanisms for invasiveness in Centuarea that are not unique to invaded ranges."

           "abstract": "The endemic Cuban Eleutherodactylus limbatus group contains five species of miniature species of frogs (E. cubanus, E. iberia, E. jaumei, E. limbatus, E. orientalis), and one larger and more generalized species (E. etheridgei). Several of the miniature species have contrasting colour patterns with bright yellow or white stripes on a dark dorsum, and two of these species are known to sequester skin alkaloids. Based on a review of literature, museum data and numerous own, unpublished field records we provide an updated list of georeferenced locality records of all species of the group that confirms their strict allopatric distribution pattern despite the close geographic proximity of some species. A phylogenetic tree based on newly analysed partial DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (566 bp) placed the dull-coloured species E. etheridgei and E. cubanus in a basal position, followed by a well-differentiated E. orientalis, and a highly supported but poorly differentiated clade containing E. iberia, E. jaumei and E. limbatus. In addition to these three forms, this clade also included various subclades with a similar degree of differentiation, which rendered paraphyletic the formally described species, indicating the need for a taxonomic revision. The evolution of contrasting dorsal colour patterns (dorsolateral stripes on a dark brown, light brown or yellow dorsum) apparently was characterized by homoplasy. The highest diversity of this group is concentrated in small areas in the eastern mountains, and the population of E. limbatus sampled from western Cuba was genetically similar to an eastern Cuban population, suggesting that only one relatively shallow evolutionary lineage might have succeeded in expanding its range into the west of the island."

           "abstract": "Ecological niche models are commonly used to identify regions at risk of species invasions. Relying on climate alone may limit a model’s success when additional variables contribute to invasion. While a climate-based model may predict the future spread of an invasive plant, we hypothesized that a model that combined climate with human influences would most successfully explain its present distribution. We used the ecological niche model MaxEnt to test our hypothesis with Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), a common invasive horticultural plant in the United States. We first predicted the future range expansion of the species in the United States using a model that was trained on the climate conditions in its native range. We then tested the ability of a climate-based model, which was trained on climate conditions in the invaded range, to predict the current distribution in the United States. Finally, we tested whether including a measure of human influence would improve this model. Our results indicate that, despite L. japonica’s 200-year invasion history, it is expected to spread beyond its current US range. Climate and human influence combined explain the current distribution. Modeling the spread of invasive horticultural plants using climate alone risks under-predicting areas with poor climates and high human influence. Therefore, planting invasive horticultural species should be discouraged as even suboptimal climates may result in further range expansion."

           "abstract": "Outcrossing in the aquatic genus Nymphoides (about 50 species) is promoted by various sexual condi- tions including dimorphic heterostyly (most species) and dioecy (four species). In eastern North America, Nymphoides aquatica and Nymphoides cordata are dioecious sister species that differ only slightly by their leaf pigmentation and texture, adventitious root form, and overall size. Although these features dis- tinguish most individuals, the occurrence of morphologically intermediate specimens within broadly overlapping geographic ranges often confounds their identification. Hybridization of these taxa has not been documented previously, yet the potential exists for gene flow between N. aquatica and N. cordata because of their similar floral morphology, reliance on outcrossing, and partial sympatry. We studied indi- viduals collected across the ranges of N. aquatica and N. cordata, using morphological data and nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (matK/trnK) molecular sequence data, to better ascertain their distinctness and to investigate further the possibility of hybridization. Quantitative morphological data supported the exis- tence of two species that are broadly diagnosable across several measurements, although approximately seven percent of specimens analyzed remained undiagnosed under our criteria. Molecular phylogenetic results indicated that most individuals of N. aquatica and N. cordata were readily identifiable to one or the other species, and these corresponded to reciprocally monophyletic groups. However, molecular cloning revealed that some individuals collected within the sympatric range of N. aquatica and N. cordata were interspecific hybrids, and these individuals on average were morphologically intermediate between the two parental species. These data are consistent with a taxonomic concept that accepts two fundamentally distinct Nymphoides species, nevertheless with some individuals being morphologically intermediate, at least partly as a result of natural interspecific hybridization. ©"

           "abstract": "Trichomonas vaginalis can be infected with double stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses known as T. vaginalis virus (TVV). This viral infection may have important implications for trichomonal virulence and disease pathogenesis. In this study we identified and genetic characterized three strains of TVVs isolated from T. vaginalis in Cuba. The three new predicted sequences of capsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase amounted to the previously determined 20 TVV sequences and other 21 viruses of Totiviridae family were used for a phylogenetic analysis. Four distinct monophyletic clades are shown in a phylogenetic tree. One corresponds with TVVs, other with Victorivirus, Leishmaniavirus and Eimeria brunetti virus and, other with viruses of the genus Totivirus and the last with Giardiavirus. The E. brunetti virus is identified in the phylogenetic tree as independent taxon between Leishmaniavirus and Victorivirus isolates, most closely related to Victorivirus. TVV constitute a monophyletic cluster distinguishable from all other viruses in Totiviridae family. This result suggested that TVV may be grouped in a separated genus and not inside of Giardiavirus. TVVs appear to be more closely related to protozoan viruses in the genus Leishmaniavirus and to fungal viruses in the genus Victorivirus than to other protozoan and fungal viruses in Giardiavirus and Totivirus. Among TVVs, four main groups can be recognized within Trichomonasvirus cluster, which correspond with the previous species classification proposed. Further studies, with more TVV strains, especially TVV3 and 4 strains, are needed in order to determine the phylogenetic relationship among Trichomonasvirus genus and specifically if TVV2 and 3 each also constitute a well-delimited group."

           "abstract": "Bottom trawl fishery is one of the most important coastal fisheries in Taiwan both in production and economic values. However, its annual production started to decline due to overfishing since the 1980s. Its bycatch problem also damages the fishery resource seriously. Tus, the government banned the bottom fishery within 3 nautical miles along the shoreline in 1989. To evaluate the effectiveness of this policy, a four year survey was conducted from 2000–2003, in the waters around Taiwan and Penghu (Pescadore) Islands, one region each year respectively. All fish specimens collected from trawling were brought back to lab for identification, individual number count and body weight measurement. Tese raw data have been integrated and established in Taiwan Fish Database (http://fishdb.sinica.edu.tw). Tey have also been published through TaiBIF (http://taibif.tw), FishBase and GBIF (website see below). Tis dataset contains 631 fish species and 3,529 records, making it the most complete demersal fish fauna and their temporal and spatial distributional data on the soft marine habitat in Taiwan."

           "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered. RESULTS: There are ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms, that 58,000-72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000-741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7-1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 ± 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century."

We further present a new system design to visually explore the complex relationships among geographical, environmental and taxonomic components of global biodiversity data with higher level of performance. In addition to leveraging existing performance boosting techniques, the new deign utilizes data parallel computing power of GPUs that are already available on commodity personal computers for indexing and query processing."

Dominant species consist of 716 Hirundo rustica (18.70%), 707 Passer montanus (18.47%), 335 Charadrius alexandrinus (8.75%) and 197 Egretta alba modesta (5.15%). By months, 1,899 individuals of 58 species and 1,989 species of 62 species were discovered in June and September, respectively. However, the frequencies do not show much difference. Diversity and abundance of species are 3.07 and 10.06, respectively."

Samples collected along their ranges were analyzed by nuclear isozymes and uniparentally inherited chloroplast DNA sequences. Modern and past last glacial maximum (LGM) ecological niche modeling (ENM) was developed using current climate data based on 19 bioclimatic variables and topography. Populations of the subtropical of P. parlatorei shared most haplotypes, southern populations were genetically distinct, and ENM yielded range expansion during the LGM. Latitudinally extreme populations of the temperate N. pumilio shared isozyme variants which was consistent with ENM showing suitable northern and southern areas. In contrast cpDNA yielded an ancient phylogeographic structure. Cold-hardy trees locally persisted along their ranges through ice periods without major range shifts in tropical and temperate regions."

Due to their unique adaptive capacities, fungi and beetles co-occur and interact in various terrestrial habitats. In addition to commensal and mutualistic fungus–beetle relations, combative interactions involve aggressors from both sides such as entomopathogenic fungi and fungivorous beetles. Fungivory, most commonly in combination with saprophagy and xylophagy, is characteristic of many families of Coleoptera. The resource-exploiting fungal mycelia are most frequently consumed by beetles together with the woody substrata. The focus of the present review is on Coleoptera with larvae or adults feeding on a primarily fungal diet: fruit bodies and spores."

We present available information on the richness, endemicity, and distribution of each freshwater organism group within the Med, and make a comparison with Palearctic diversity. Approximately 35% of known Palearctic freshwater species and more than 6% of the World’s freshwater species are present in the Med. A high degree of endemicity is found in the Med freshwater biota. These data, together with the degree to which many freshwater species are threatened, support the inclusion of the Med among World biodiversity hotspots. Nevertheless, knowledge of Med biodiversity is still incomplete, particularly for some taxa. Regarding to the spatial distribution of species within the Med, the richest area is the North, although patterns differ among groups. A comparison of the ecological and biological traits of endemic and non-endemic species of three riverine groups (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) revealed that endemic species have several strategies and mechanisms to face typical mediterranean-climate conditions, such as drought, when compared to non-endemic species. We briefly analyse the conservation status of the region’s biodiversity. Finally, we present some future challenges regarding the knowledge and protection of Med freshwater biodiversity."

The largest of these, the Australian Government’s Biodiversity Fund, will invest A$946 million to revegetate, rehabili- tate and restore landscapes to store carbon, enhance biodiversity and build environmental resilience under climate change. The universal challenge for restoration practitioners working within these programmes is species selection for both current and future environmental con- ditions at a given site. For policy makers, the challenge is to provide guidelines and tools for this process. The first paper in this series of two papers looked at scientific methods that could provide underpinning knowledge to improve the assessment of species vulnerability to climatic and atmospheric change. In this paper, the publically accessible Atlas of Living Aus- tralia is used to demonstrate how revegetation project leaders can assess whether the spe- cies and provenances used in their revegetation projects are likely to be suitable for changing environmental conditions. While using the Atlas can assist current selections, ways in which more reliable selections for changing climatic conditions could be made are also outlined."

The subject is not static, however, and as more and more demanding questions are asked of palaeolimnology in the future, there will be more and more future numerical challenges to be addressed and subjects to be explored. These include the problems of model selection, trait analysis, data-mining, time-warp analysis, quantile regression, additive modelling, new techniques for temporal- series analysis, and increasing use of Bayesian inference. The practical problems of computing and of available software are also discussed and it is clear that future developments in quantitative palaeolimnology will depend on researchers becoming proficient in the use of R and its innumerable packages relevant to palaeolimnological data-analysis."

Global assessments of extinction risk to species have been completed by IUCN for multiple taxa. The IUCN global assessments have had a major impact on conservation science and practice as well as biodiversity funding mechanisms though the Global Environment Facility, the World Bank, and the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF). A signature of the assessments is a process of sustained interaction between conservation organizations and the research and academic community, effectively integrating science and policy on global scale. The model relies on several critical components: openness of the conservation community to scientific input and debate, engagement of the scientific community, conservation organization mediated data collation, and data sharing with ease of access. This model can be applied to other challenges to conserve biodiversity and assess how biodiversity loss affects the well-being of societies across the world. The recognition of the importance of biodiversity in meeting the Millennium Development Goals and the recognition of the failure to meet the 2010 Biodiversity Target illustrate the gap between what needs to be achieved and our current trajectory."

Of these, 13 species have previously not been recorded from Finnmark, i.e.: Coniopteryx tineiformis Curtis, 1834; Hemerobius atrifrons McLachlan, 1868; H. fenestratus Tjeder, 1932; H. humulinus Linnaeus, 1758; H. marginatus Stephens, 1836; H. nitidulus Fabricius, 1777; H. pini Stephens, 1836; Micromus angulatus (Stephens, 1836); Sympherobius fuscescens (Wallengren, 1863); Wesmaelius concinnus (Stephens, 1836); W. mortoni (McLachlan, 1899); W. quadrifasciatus (Reuter, 1894) and Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens, 1836). The total number of Neuroptera known to occur in Finnmark is now 23 of which four belong in the family Coniopterygidae, 17 in Hemerobidae, and one in each of the families Chrysopidae and Sisyridae. All four species of Megaloptera reported in this paper belong to the genus Sialis Latreille, 1802, the sole genus of the order occurring in Norway. One of these, Sialis sibirica McLachlan, 1872, is recorded as Data Deficient (DD) in the 2010 Norwegian Red List for Species. In addition to the four species reported here a fifth species, Sialis lutaria (Linnaeus, 1758) is known to occur in Finnmark."

The hypothesis that cushion or nurse plants in general are important to multiple trophic levels has been proposed but rarely tested. Alpine arthropod diversity is also largely understudied worldwide, and the plant-arthropod interactions reported are mostly negative, that is,. herbivory. Plant and arthropod diversity and abundance were sampled on S. acaulis and at paired adjacent microsites with other non-cushion forming vegetation present on Whistler Mountain, B.C., Canada to examine the relative trophic effects of cushion plants. Plant species richness and abundance but not Simpson’s diversity index was higher on cushion microsites relative to other vegetation. Arthropod richness, abundance, and diversity were all higher on cushion microsites relative to other vegetated sites. On a microclimatic scale, S. acaulis ameliorated stressful conditions for plants and invertebrates living inside it, but the highest levels of arthropod diversity were observed on cushions with tall plant growth. Hence, alpine cushion plants can be foundation species not only for other plant species but other trophic levels, and these impacts are expressed through both direct and indirect effects associated with altered environmental conditions and localized productivity. Whilst this case study tests a limited subset of the membership of alpine animal communities, it clearly demonstrates that cushion-forming plant species are an important consideration in understanding resilience to global changes for many organisms in addition to other plants."

           "abstract": "1. Assignment of large numbers of vegetation plots to a priori vegetation classifications is increasingly being required to support natural resource management,monitoring and conservation at regional scales. Several auto- mated systems have been developed that use quantitative synoptic tables and algorithm-based plot-to-type assignment.However,where synoptic tables do not exist, and qualitative species lists characterise vegetation type classifications, existing systems may not apply. In these situations, vegetation experts may resort to manual assignment processes that can be slow, subjective and fraughtwith difficulties. 2. This study combines repeatable and objective quantitative analyses, with new software, to deliver a semi- automated plot-to-type assignment process appropriate for apriori classifications based on qualitative species lists. The flexible semi-automated assignment program (SAAP) calculates a quantitative goodness-of-fit score between plots and types, based on the species that characterise each apriori vegetation type, and the species that characterise groups of plots derived from quantitative analyses. 3. Weapplied the SAAP to a case-study of 630 native vascular plant species from 930 plots, and an apriori clas- sification of 99 vegetation types.We varied vegetation data set transforms [cover per cent (0–100%), cover score (0–6) and presence–absence (1, 0)] and analysis settings and tested the degree to which the SAAP provided plot- to-type assignment concordant withmanual expert assignment. 4. Results provided clear evidence supporting the choice of particular data set transformations and analysis set- tings tomaximise concordance. The SAAP allocated up to 50% of plots to the same expert-assigned vegetation type, and more than70%of plots to an expert-assignedvegetationtyperankedinthe topfive by theSAAP. 5. When coupled with repeatable and objective quantitative analyses, the SAAP provides vegetation experts with a new semi-automated and quantitative decision support tool to assist with the assignment of vegetation plotswithin apriori vegetation classifications defined by characteristic species lists."

In order to test the representativeness of genetic accessions commonly used in these studies, we investigated the A. halleri population genetic structure in Europe. Microsatellite and nucleotide polymorphisms from the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, respectively, were used to genotype 65 populations scattered over Europe. The large-scale population structure was characterized by a significant phylogeographic signal between two major genetic units. The localization of the phylogeographic break was assumed to result from vicariance between large populations isolated in southern and central Europe, on either side of ice sheets covering the Alps during the Quaternary ice ages. Genetic isolation was shown to be maintained in western Europe by the high summits of the Alps, whereas admixture was detected in the Carpathians. Considering the phylogeographic literature, our results suggest a distinct phylogeographic pattern for European species occurring in both mountain and lowland habitats. Considering the evolution of metal adaptation in A. halleri, it appears that recent adaptations to anthropogenic metal stress that have occurred within either phylogeographic unit should be regarded as independent events that potentially have involved the evolution of a variety of genetic mechanisms."

           "abstract": "Biodiversity informatics has experienced tremendous developments in the last 15 years. There are now comprehensive online checklists for plant taxa as well as many large plant-taxon related databases, including the vegetation-plot databases registered in the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD; http://www.givd.info). However, efficient maintenance, analysis, and inte- gration of these databases are still much impeded by the failure of presently available electronic taxonomic reference lists of plants to fully meet the requirements of such applications. Here we outline the principal specifications of an electronic taxonomic reference list for Europe (“EuroSL” = European standard list of plant taxa) and identify features not met in current practice. EuroSL should cover all macroscopic taxa of vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, and algae that occur in European vegetation in a uniform database, irrespec- tive of their floristic status (e.g. native, archaeophyte, neophyte, casual). The adoption of informal aggregates is essential to cover de- viating species concepts and to capture legacy data. EuroSL should not only assign names but also match taxonomic concepts. This task cannot be fully automated, as the same correctly applied taxon name can have different meanings depending on the taxonomic concept applied. In order to be a useful tool, EuroSL would need to be better documented than most existing electronic checklists and be released in fixed versions. Every subsequent version should contain an unambiguous connection linking each taxon to the corre- sponding unit in the previous version. We identify possible components of EuroSL, of which Euro+Med PlantBase, the recent Euro- pean checklists of bryophytes, and the taxonomic crosswalks between various national Turboveg checklists collected for SynBioSys Europe, are the major ones. Concepts developed for GermanSL might be adopted for EuroSL, but implemented in a software frame- work that is yet to be developed from existing tools. Such a framework would allow documented editing of the content by specialists distributed across Europe. To become successful, EuroSL would require intensive collaboration between taxonomists, ecologists and biodiversity informaticians, as well as appropriate funding. Establishing EuroSL would dramatically enhance the usability and reliabil- ity of plant-taxon related databases in Europe for the purposes of pure and applied research and conservation legislation. Its develop- ment should therefore be of highest priority."

Primary biodiversity data are data records derived from direct observation of species occurrences in nature or describing specimens in biological collections. The Darwin Core terms can be seen as an extension to the standard Dublin Core metadata terms. The new Darwin Core extension for genebanks declares the additional terms required for describing genebank data sets, and is based on established standards from the plant genetic resources community. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) provides an information infrastructure for biodiversity data including a suite of software tools for data publishing, distributed data access, and the capture of biodiversity data. The Darwin Core extension for genebanks is a key component that provides access for the genebanks and the plant genetic resources community to the GBIF informatics infrastructure including the new toolkits for data exchange. This paper provides one of the first examples and guidelines for how to create extensions to the Darwin Core standard."

           "abstract": "Few empirical studies have measured the effects of climate change on tropical biodiversity, and this paucity has contributed to uncertainty in predicting the severity of climate change on tropical organisms. With regards to elevational changes, most studies have either re-sampled historical systematic survey sites or analyzed time series of occurrence data at long-term study sites. Such data sources are unavailable for most tropical mountains, so other methods of detecting elevational changes must be sought. Here we combine data from published checklists, recent fi eld work, peer-reviewed literature, unpublished reports, birdwatchers’ trip reports, databases of birdwatchers’ observations, audio recordings, and photographs to compare historical (pre-1998) and current (post-2006) bird distributions on Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Records were carefully checked by experts on Bornean birds. More species are now known from Mt. Kinabalu, but historical data provided elevational range estimates for more species than current data because of extensive mountain-wide collections and surveys. Most elevational comparisons for this study had to be limited to the 1450–1900 m elevational band, where most of the recent work has been done. Information was compiled into an annotated list of 342 species from 200–4095 m. We present this list to encourage refi nement of the dataset and future work on elevational distributions on the mountain. Of 58 species with suffi cient data from 1450 m to the summit, 38 appear to have shifted their ranges (24 species upslope and 14 downslope). A total of 22 resident species have recently been observed above their published maximum elevation for Borneo. Some species that have shifted upwards, such as Chalcophaps indica and Pellorneum pyrrogenys, are now common or breeding at elevations above their published maximum. Fifteen species appear to have declined on the mountain, probably as a result of habitat loss outside the protected area. Several of the upslope shifts are probably attributable to climate change, but many downslope shifts may be artifacts of incomplete recent sampling. The upward shifts agree with the few other tropical range comparisons that have been published. Our approach demonstrates the viability of combining diverse data sources (of varying accuracy and bias) to detect distributional shifts from climate change."

           "abstract": "The three subgenera of alder (Alnusroman Clethropsis and Alnobetula) are taxonomically distinctive, but how does their pollen match up with their gross morphology? This study links pollen characters with the taxonomic divisions of the genus alder based on nrDNA ITS sequence data. The value of the study is in the breadth of the taxonomic coverage of the three subgenera, as the samples per species only range from 1 to 6. From 29 Alnus species, the authors studied pollen from 59 modern reference collections (prepared by acetolysis) and recorded the number and type of apertures (pores), thickness of the arci, pollen size and polar arci. Tallies of the number of pores on the pollen grains in a reference collection typically have a range of ± 1 or 2. Exceptions are presumed hybrid collections in Alnus rugosa with a range of ± 5, which have malformed pollen cells suggesting infertility. The presumed hybrids show a greater range of both pore number and size of pollen grains. The dominant pore number is a key feature that separates the subgenus Alnobetula (= Alnaster) from the other two subgenera by consistently having predominantly 5-, 6- or 7-pored pollen grains, while all other Alnus taxa sampled have pollen with predominantly 4- or 5-pored pollen. The dominant pore number is a consistent feature within the subgenus Alnobetula (10 species), but is inconsistent in 3 out of 16 species of the subgenus Alnus and within the subgenus Clethropsis (3 species). Thickenings of the pore lip, aspidate (protruding) and vestibulate pores are important features of Alnus pollen on a species level. Alnus-like pollen morphology occurs occasionally in certain other betulaceous genera (Betula and Carpinus). Differences in character or thickness of arci (band-like thickenings on the pollen wall between pores) tend to be somewhat consistent within a species and vary within subgenera. Two Alnobetula species in the Alnus viridis complex (Alnus crispa and Alnus sinuata) have arci that are weakly developed or appear as simple folds; walls are fragile and pores are typically less aspidate. Pollen sizes in different species overlap greatly, may be partly influenced by processing methods and do not seem to be generally helpful in characterizing species. Circular doughnut-shaped arci thickenings on the polar area of pollen grains are a common feature (16–40%) in two closely related East Asian taxa of subgenus Alnobetula with large pollen (‘Clade A’: Alnus firma and Alnus sieboldii). These ‘Clade A’ features have been reported from Miocene collections of Alnus pollen from Alaska, and support megafossil evidence in determining the biogeography of this group along the Pacific Rim in the Neogene. The Miocene appearance of subgenus Alnobetula megafossils in both Alaska and Japan can only have occurred via a Bering Land Bridge. This relation is now confirmed by Reinink-Smith's Miocene ‘Clade-A-type’ pollen data of Alaska. These taxa had Pacific Rim distributions, similar fruiting carposamaras and now correspond to a DNA ITS subgroup within Alnobetula. Depending on the geographic location with limited number of local alder species, certain Holocene identifications are possible based on pore structure and arci thickness, e.g. the Alnus crispa-type in eastern Canada and the Alnus sinuata-type in the Pacific northwest."

The ERA for terrestrial agroecosystems is well-developed, whereas guidance for ERA of GM crops in aquatic ecosystems is not as well-defined. The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how comprehensive problem formulation can be used to develop a conceptual model and to identify potential exposure pathways, using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize as a case study. Within problem formulation, the insecticidal trait, the crop, the receiving environment, and protection goals were characterized, and a conceptual model was developed to identify routes through which aquatic organisms may be exposed to insecticidal proteins in maize tissue. Following a tiered approach for exposure assessment, worst-case exposures were estimated using standardized models, and factors mitigating exposure were described. Based on exposure estimates, shredders were identified as the functional group most likely to be exposed to insecticidal proteins. However, even using worst-case assumptions, the exposure of shredders to Bt maize was low and studies supporting the current risk assessments were deemed adequate. Determining if early tier toxicity studies are necessary to inform the risk assessment for a specific GM crop should be done on a case by case basis, and should be guided by thorough problem formulation and exposure assessment. The processes used to develop the Bt maize case study are intended to serve as a model for performing risk assessments on future traits and crops."

           "abstract": "Similarly to plants from terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic species harbour wide spectra of root-associated fungi (RAF). However, comparably less is known about fungal diversity in submerged roots. We assessed the incidence and diversity of RAF in submerged aquatic plants using microscopy, culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. We studied RAF of five submerged isoetid species collected in four oligotrophic freshwater lakes in Norway. Levels of dark septate endophytes (DSE) colonization differed among the lakes and were positively related to the organic matter content and negatively related to pH. In total, we identified 41 fungal OTUs using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques, belonging to Mucoromycotina, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota as well as Basidiomycota. Sequences corresponding to aquatic hyphomycetes (e.g. Nectria lugdunensis, Tetracladium furcatum and Varicosporium elodeae) were obtained. Eight arbuscular mycorrhizal taxa belonging to the orders Archaeosporales, Diversisporales and Glomerales were also detected. However, the vast majority of the fungal species detected (e.g. Ceratobasidium sp., Cryptosporiopsis rhizophila, Leptodontidium orchidicola, and Tuber sp.) have previously been known only from roots of terrestrial plants. The abundance and phylogenetic distribution of mycorrhizal as well as nonmycorrhizal fungi in the roots of submerged plants have reshaped our views on the fungal diversity in aquatic environment."

Input data for each method was drawn from the same variables: fishing pressure, exposure to climate change, and biodiversity (habitats, species distributions, biological richness, and biodiversity value). The first method compares visual color classifications of primary variables, the second uses binary combinations of these variables to produce a categorical classification of management actions, the third is a target-based optimization using Marxan, and the fourth is conservation ranking with Zonation. We present results from each method, and compare the latter three approaches for spatial coverage, biodiversity representation, fishing cost and persistence probability. All results included large areas in the north, central, and southern parts of western Madagascar. Achieving 30% representation targets with Marxan required twice the fish catch loss than the categorical method. The categorical classification and Zonation do not consider targets for conservation features. However, when we reduced Marxan targets to 16.3%, matching the representation level of the “strict protection” class of the categorical result, the methods show similar catch losses. The management category portfolio has complete coverage, and presents several management recommendations including strict protection. Zonation produces rapid conservation rankings across large, diverse datasets. Marxan is useful for identifying strict protected areas that meet representation targets, and minimize exposure probabilities for conservation features at low economic cost. We show that methods based on Zonation and a simple combination of variables can produce results comparable to Marxan for species representation and catch losses, demonstrating the value of comparing alternative approaches during initial stages of the planning process. Choosing an appropriate approach ultimately depends on scientific and political factors including representation targets, likelihood of adoption, and persistence goals."

           "abstract": "Ecological niche models assume a species niche should be conserved over space and time. Increasingly, studies have determined that niche shifts may occur during biological invasion events. The aim of this study is to examine niche conservation for two invasive crane flies, Tipula oleracea Linnaeus and Tipula paludosa Meigen, after introductions into North America. These species have broadly sympatric invasive distributions but differ in time since introduction and dispersal abilities. As these factors may impact the area accessible to dispersal, I examined the impact of background area delineation on conclusions of niche conservation. Results indicated that alternative delineations of accessible area (i.e., background area) had no affect on measures of niche equivalence. Neither Tipula species was found to be occupying invasive niche space equivalent to that of their native ranges. Niche dissimilarity was found for both species, with results strongly impacted by the choice of background area. T. paludosa introductions displayed a niche shift across both invasive introductions when the model area drew climatic information from an area that buffered occurrences by 40 km. The eastern T. oleracea introduction displayed a niche shift when background information was drawn from within a 400 km buffered area. This study suggests that invasive populations may be displaying a niche shift when evaluated against one scale of background but conserved when evaluated against another scale. Dispersal limitations for T. oleracea in its eastern introduction and anthropogenic habitat associations for T. paludosa across both invasive introductions are indicated as causes for the observed niche shifts. The results of this study highlight the importance of carefully delineating the area accessible to invasive species in studies of niche conservation. Furthermore, it indicates that examining several spatial extents of background areas can be beneficial when examining niche conservation for species in non-equilibrium states."

           "abstract": "Within southern Africa, a link between past climatic changes and faunal diversification has been hypothesized for a diversity of taxa. To test the hypothesis that evolutionary divergences may be correlated to vegetation changes (induced by changes in climate), we selected the widely distributed four-striped mouse, Rhabdomys, as a model. Two species are currently recognized, the mesic-adapted R. dilectus and arid-adapted R. pumilio. However, the morphology-based taxonomy and the distribution boundaries of previously described subspecies remain poorly defined. The current study, which spans seven biomes, focuses on the spatial genetic structure of the arid-adapted R. pumilio (521 specimens from 31 localities), but also includes limited sampling of the mesic-adapted R. dilectus (33 specimens from 10 localities) to act as a reference for interspecific variation within the genus. The mitochondrial COI gene and four nuclear introns (Eef1a1, MGF, SPTBN1, Bfib7) were used for the construction of gene trees. Mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate that Rhabdomys consists of four reciprocally monophyletic, geographically structured clades, with three distinct lineages present within the arid-adapted R. pumilio. These monophyletic lineages differ by at least 7.9% (±0.3) and these results are partly confirmed by a multilocus network of the combined nuclear intron dataset. Ecological niche modeling in MaxEnt supports a strong correlation between regional biomes and the distribution of distinct evolutionary lineages of Rhabdomys. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock suggests that the geographic clades diverged between 3.09 and 4.30Ma, supporting the hypothesis that the radiation within the genus coincides with paleoclimatic changes (and the establishment of the biomes) characterizing the Miocene-Pliocene boundary. Marked genetic divergence at the mitochondrial DNA level, coupled with strong nuclear and mtDNA signals of non-monophyly of R. pumilio, support the notion that a taxonomic revision of the genus is needed."

We linked part of the identifiers to two external data providers, thus creating a virtual common platform including several ecological repositories. We used the Global Biodiversity Facility (GBIF) as well the International Plant Name Index (IPNI) to enrich the data from our own field observations. We conclude in discussing other potential providers for identifiers for the ecological research domain. We demonstrate the ease of making use of existing decentralized and unsupervised identifiers for a data repository, which opens new avenues to collaborative data discovery for learning, teaching, and research in ecology"

Geographic coverage includes the islands Ha’apai, Niua, Tongatapu, Vava’u, and surrounding smaller islands. It is apparent that there remain many localities in Tonga, including entire islands, which have never or scarcely been collected for this group of plants. We report three hornwort and 47 liverwort taxa. Two additional liverwort taxa previously reported from Tonga are noted as doubtful records. The list is based on over 35 literature references from over 5000 papers that the ELPT project has processed so far, including monographs and regional studies. New records will undoubtedly be reported, based on regionally widespread species that have been recorded elsewhere, especially nearby Fiji and Samoa. It is clear Tonga has received negligible attention, and almost no publications exist that have focused solely on this group of islands. The current checklist is part of a broader study producing checklists for islands across the South Pacifi c, which we hope will foster and encourage research of liverworts and hornworts in this globally important biodiversity hotspot."

           "abstract": "Biodiversity information obtained during environmental impact assessments (EIAs) is rarely accessible for other uses following the completion of the EIA. Such data need to be made readily accessible; adding them to publicly accessible national datasets is important if biodiversity science, conservation and future decisions based on environmental assessment are to benefit from new biodiversity data and improved biodiversity data coverage. An ‘EIA Biodiversity Data Publishing Framework’, based on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) global standards, is thus proposed to meet this need. This paper outlines the GBIF-catalysed initiative to establish such an operational framework for uptake by the EIA community, as well as options that are available for data publishing in the absence of such a framework. It reviews the current state of accessibility and management of the primary biodiversity data associated with EIA studies, and highlights the urgent need for uptake of a range of data-publishing tools and best practices for making EIA biodiversity data exchangeable using globally accepted standards. Lessons learnt from pilot projects in India and South Africa underline the call for the rapid uptake of a national-to-global scale EIA Biodiversity Data Publishing Framework."

The papers in this special issue provide accounts of these technologies in use in teaching, learning and curriculum development in higher education. Several of the papers suggest that these new web technologies have important roles to play in changing pedagogical practices in higher education settings in which teachers and students are seen as designers of their own learning technologies and as producers of new knowledge. The authors argue that the theorisation, development and adoption of Semantic Web and linked data technologies would be well served by a ‘turn to practice’ and a focus not on learning technologies in higher education but on the meaning-making practices, discourses and controversies around technologies in higher education."

One key hypothesis has been that abundance declines with geographical distance from the range centre, but tests of this idea have shown that the effect may occur indeed only in a minority of cases. We explore an alternative hypothesis: that species’ abundances decline with distance from the centroid of the species’ habitable conditions in environmental space (the ecological niche). We demonstrate consistent negative abundance–ecological distance relation- ships across all 11 species analysed (turtles to wolves), and that relationships in environmental space are consistently stronger than relationships in geographical space."

This underpins the greater water-use efficiency in C(4) species and their tendency to occupy drier, more seasonal environments than their C(3) relatives. The basis of interspecific variation in maximum stomatal conductance to water (g(max) ), as defined by stomatal density and size, was investigated in a common-environment screening experiment. Stomatal traits were measured in 28 species from seven grass lineages, and comparative methods were used to test for predicted effects of C(3) and C(4) photosynthesis, annual precipitation and habitat wetness on g(max) . Novel results were as follows: significant phylogenetic patterns exist in g(max) and its determinants, stomatal size and stomatal density; C(4) species consistently have lower g(max) than their C(3) relatives, associated with a shift towards smaller stomata at a given density. A direct relationship between g(max) and precipitation was not supported. However, we confirmed associations between C(4) photosynthesis and lower precipitation, and showed steeper stomatal size-density relationships and higher g(max) in wetter habitats. The observed relationships between stomatal patterning, photosynthetic pathway and habitat provide a clear example of the interplay between anatomical traits, physiological innovation and ecological adaptation in plants."

           "abstract": "When we walk watching our feet we feel as though we are moving faster. However, in so doing and even if we have a target in mind we may be taking the wrong route. Like broader society our scientific system has been walking faster and faster, or so we imagine. I posit the view that the time has come to look up and consider where our current path is leading us and to consider new routes, as the need for long-term thinking is more pres- sing than ever. In scientific researchweare witnessing an ever faster race to publish since the first publication metrics and the quantitative evaluation of researcher performances were invented. Some of the most obvious drifts of this race have been increasingly discussed since the 1990s (e.g. Gendron, 2008; Hochberg et al., 2009; Jacqué, 2011; Lawrence, 2003, 2007; Mulligan, 2004; Statzner and Resh, 2010; Tainer, 1991; West, 2010) and their causes generally attributed to mechanisms within our scientific systems (e.g. competition, reputation). By contrast, Statzner and Resh (2010) recently suggested that science is being affected by “complex changes such as globalization and the increasing dominance of com- mercial interest”, where quantity of publications as the ultimate performance measure for scientists is having serious consequences not only on the quality of papers, but also on how the whole research process is being conducted (see also Gendron, 2008; Lawrence, 2003, 2007). Indeed, since our scientific system and we scien- tists are part of a society and political governance where the paradigm of “more is better” prevails, there is no rea- son to think that science is not affected by the negative drifts of such a productivity race."

           "abstract": "Species are predicted to respond to global warming through “cold-ward” shifts in their geographic distributions due to encroachment into newly suitable habitats and/or dieback in areas that become climatically unsuitable. I conduct one of the first ever tests of this hypothesis for tropical plant species. I test for changes in the thermal distributions of 239 South American tropical plant species using dated herbarium records for specimens collected between 1970 and 2009. Supporting a priori predictions, many species (59%) exhibit some evidence of significant cold-ward range shifts even after correcting for collection biases. Over 1/3 of species (35%) show significant cold-ward movement in their hot thermal limits (mean rate of change = 0.022°C yr−1). Most of these species (85%; 30% of all study species) show no corresponding shift in their cold thermal limits. These unbalanced changes in the species’ thermal range limits may indicate species that are experiencing dieback due to their intolerance of rising temperatures coupled with an inability to expand into newly climatically-suitable habitats. On the other hand, 25% of species show significant cold-ward shifts in their cold thermal range limits (mean rate of change = 0.003°C yr−1), but 80% of these species (20% of all study species) show no corresponding shift in their hot thermal range limits. In these cases, the unbalanced shifts may indicate species that are able to “benefit” under global warming, at least temporally, by both tolerating rising temperatures and expanding into new suitable habitat. An important ancillary result of this study is that the number of species exhibiting significant range shifts was greatly influenced by shifting collector biases. This highlights the need to account for biases when analyzing natural history records or other long-term records."

We analyze the distribution patterns of anuran amphibians within the Cerrado domain of South America in a historical framework. First, we provide an updated list of species based on extensive research in zoological collections and fieldwork. We then explore patterns of endemism and the distribution of species occurring both in Cerrado and each of the adjoining domains, providing directions for future hypotheses tests. We found 209 anuran species occurring in localities within Cerrado. Among them, 150 are primarily associated with Cerrado, and 59 are typical of one of the Cerrado adjoining domains. Widespread species account for only 14% of the Cerrado typical species. Species occurring in Cerrado and one adjoining domain present a highly structured spatial pattern in which Amazonian species are restricted to the northwestern Cerrado, Atlantic species to the southeastern Cerrado, Caatinga species to the northeastern Cerrado, and Chaco species to the southwestern Cerrado. Cerrado endemics occur in most localities and in all regions, whereas narrow endemics (< 60,000 km2 ) are restricted to mountain ranges in central, southeastern, and southwestern Cerrado. The limited distribution of species shared with one of the four adjoining domains highlights the influence of independent species pools more associated with other domains."

           "abstract": "This article reports the first record of the Nudibranch Polycera hedgpethi in the Lagoon of Venice (Italy), as well as its established presence in the Mediterranean Sea after its first record in 1986 in lake Fusaro (Naples). In less than 50 years P. hedgpethi has spread throughout the world’s temperate and subtropical waters, preferring protected coastal environments and other semi-enclosed coastal water bodies such as ports, harbours and lagoons. Shipping is the most likely vector. The species distribution shows a temperate subtropical range, at about 7458 of latitude both North and South. Polycera hedgpethi was collected during a survey in 2009 and its presence confirmed for the following two years. All individuals collected were found attached to the bryozoan Bugula neritina, to which it is linked trophically, suggesting a determined pattern of distribution. The present finding is the northernmost record for the species."

           "abstract": "Knowledge discovery from data in environmental sciences is becoming more and more important nowadays because of the deluge of information found in databases of digital ecosystems, coming altogether from institutions and amateurs. For example in biodiversity science, all these data need to be validated by specialists with the help of Intelligent Environmental Decision Support Systems (IEDSSs), then enhanced and certified into qualitative knowledge before reaching their audience. Data mining through classification or clustering is the dedicated inductive process of grouping descriptions based on similarity measures, then building classes and naming them. Later, the formed concepts can be reused for identification purpose with new observations. The problem is that when using such knowledge-based systems, we tend to forget the fundamental role of subjects (end- users) in the definition, observation and description of objects. In order to get good identification results, a consensus must be found between these experts and amateurs for interpreting correctly the observed objects. Thus, a new method of Knowledge discovery is necessary by switching from Data mining to Sign management. The method focuses on the process of building knowledge by sharing signs and significations (Semiotic Web), more than on knowledge transmission with intelligent object representations (Semantic Web). Sign management is the shift of paradigm for Biodiversity Informatics that we have investigated in such domains as enhancing natural heritage with ICT. In this paper, we will present Sign management and illustrate this concept with two knowledge bases built in La Reunion Island for corals’ classification with IKBS (Iterative Knowledge Base System) and plants identification with Xper2 software platform."

We assembled monthly time-series of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic richness, phytoplankton functional groups (species with similar functional traits) and physico-chemical environmental descriptors (temperature, conductivity, pH, P-PO43−, N-NO3−, light absorption). We used multiple linear regression to test: 1) the effect of environmental variability over time and depth on the accrual of plankton richness; and 2) the relative effect of richness and environmental variability on the stability of plankton. Environmental change was characterised by increase in temperature, decrease in phosphorus levels, reduced temporal variability of both, and higher heterogeneity of phosphorus over depth (spatial heterogeneity). These conditions occurred concurrently with accrual in plankton taxonomic and functional richness. Increase in temperature and spatial heterogeneity were the best predictors of phytoplankton richness, while phytoplankton richness and spatial heterogeneity had the strongest effects on zooplankton richness. Temporal stability in phytoplankton biovolume was mainly affected by variability in phosphorus and temperature, while zooplankton abundance levels were more strongly linked to fluctuations in nitrogen, temperature and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our analysis highlights that climate warming and re-oligotrophication may favour an increase in spatial (depth) heterogeneity in the water column of deep lakes, enhancing the potential for phytoplankton species co-existence and an increase in plankton richness. Our analysis also suggests that the intensity of fluctuations in key environmental variables can be a better predictor of plankton community stability then average richness."

           "abstract": "A lineage of 12 arid land shrubby species in the gymnosperm genus Ephedra (Gnetales) from North America is used to evaluate the influence of climate on speciation. With a long evolutionary history, and a well documented fossil record this lineage is an ideal model for understanding the process of speciation under a niche conservatism scenario. Using seven DNA molecular markers, Bayesian inference is carried out to uncover sister species and to estimate time of divergence of the lineages. Ecological niche models are generated for four parapatric and sympatric sister species and two analyses of niche evolution are performed, one based on ecological niche models and another using raw data and multivariate analysis. As previous analyses suggest, the diversification of North America Ephedra species may be the result of a recent secondary radiation. Both parapatric and sympatric species diverged mostly in a scenario of climatic niche conservatism. However, we also found strong evidence for niche divergence for one of the sister species pairs (E. californica-E. trifurca). Moreover, the multivariate analysis found environmental differences for some variables between sister species. The estimated divergence time of three pairs of sister species distributed in southwestern North America (E. cutleri-E. aspera, E. californica-E. trifurca and E. torreyana-E. viridis) is inferred to have occurred in the Late Miocene to Pliocene and for the sister species pair E. antisyphilitica-E. coryi distributed in the southern United States and northeastern Mexico, it was inferred from the Pliocene to Pleistocene. The orogenetic and climatic changes documented for these regions related to expansion of arid lands, may have contributed to the diversification in North American Ephedra, rather than adaptations to new climatic conditions."

           "abstract": "Objective: To introduce DataONE, a multi- institutional, multinational, and interdisciplinary collaboration that is developing the cyberinfra- structure and organizational structure to support the full information lifecycle of biological, ecologi- cal, and environmental data and tools to be used by researchers, educators, and the public at large. Setting: The dynamic world of data intensive science at the point it interacts with the grand challenges facing environmental sciences. Methods: Briefly discuss science’s “fourth para- digm,” then introduce how DataONE is being de- veloped to answer the challenges presented by this new environment. Sociocultural perspectivesare the primary focus of the discussion. Results: DataONE is highly collaborative. This is a result of its cyberinfrastructure architecture, its interdisciplinary nature, and its organizational diversity. The organizational structure of an agile management team, diverse leadership team, and productive working groups provides for a suc- cessful collaborative environment where substan- tial contributions to the DataONE mission have been made by a large number of people. Conclusions: Librarians and information science researchers are key partners in the development of DataONE. These roles are likely to grow as more scientists engage data at all points of the data lifecycle."

This use of DNA barcodes requires a reference DNA library of known taxa with which to match DNA from unidentifi ed specimens. At an even more basic level, it presupposes that the species in the regional species pool have Latin binomials. This is not the case in species-rich tropical forests in which many species are new to science or members of poorly circumscribed species complexes. This chapter describes a work- fl ow geared toward taxonomic discovery, which includes the discovery of new species, distribution records, and hybrid forms, and to management of taxonomic entities in forest inventory plots. It outlines the roles of laboratory technicians, fi eld workers and herbarium-based taxonomists, and concludes with a discussion of potential multilocus nuclear DNA approaches for identifying species in recently evolved clades."

           "abstract": "We review VegMV, the phytosociological database of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (NE Germany) with electronically stored vegetation relevés (GIVD ID EU-DE-001). The database was established in 1994 and is now hosted by the Institute of Botany and Landscape Ecology, University of Greifswald, Germany (http://www.botanik.uni-greifswald.de/VegMV). On 27 October 2011, the database contained 53,842 relevés, mostly from the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, collected by approximately 320 au- thors between 1928 and 2010. Some 28% of the relevés were taken from published papers or monographs, 42% from theses and 30% from various unpublished reports and “field books”. A wide variety of habitats occurring in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are repre- sented, but territorial coverage by relevés is uneven, with lower coverage of less attractive and poorly accessible areas. The largest numbers of relevés are from managed grasslands (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea), arable land (Stellarietea mediae), and eutrophic reed communities (Phragmito-Magno-Caricetea). We quantify and discuss possible bias in the data, such as preferential selection of sam- pling sites (habitat and small-scale preferences), taxonomic inconsistencies, spatial agglomeration, and missing values for some data elements. We present a brief introduction to the consistent phytosociological vegetation classification developed using the VegMV data. Further applications of the data and the conditions for their use are reported."

           "abstract": "While the scientific significance of museum collections has gained increasing attention in recent years, their historical contextualisation has often been neglected. Even historical collections of major significance have remained largely unexplored. Even for the material collected by eminent scientific voyageurs such as e.g. Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace or Alexander von Humboldt a complete overview is missing, let alone an inventory of the still existing material. Here, we present an account on Friedrich Dahl's research expedition to Ralum (German New Guinea) in the years 1896 to 1897 from which originate many important specimens in the natural history museum in Berlin. Dahl collected several hundreds of specimens of molluscs, birds, and reptiles and thus greatly extended the representation of the tropical fauna within the museum collection. However, in contrast to other departments, Dahl's contribution to the malacological collection has only been inventorized fragmentarily. We here identify those molluscs from Ralum that have been neglected so far and thus determine the complete amount of Dahl's malacological alcohol collection. Moreover, we outline the circumstances of this expedition and the further utilization of his specimens in subsequent museum's research. We thus integrate the Ralum project into its historical context that reveals not only its relevance for scientists and science in the past but also its significance for the present-day museum in Berlin."

This study utilizes more than 8,800 Cyprinidae occurrence data from 11 datasets and uses three different types of clustering algorithms—grid-based, partition-based, and density-based—to produce different spatial visualization results. It aims to resolve the problems of efficacy and poor visualization when large scales of species occurrence data are presented in Google Maps. The study also explores the compara- tive differences between the results obtained from the three clustering algorithms and the expert opinion range maps of Cyprinidae. It hopes to identify a quick and efficient way to present species distribution data, in turn help researchers to extract knowledge from large amount of data so that the knowledge can be tapped as important reference for ecological conservation efforts."

           "abstract": "Currently, rich and diverse data types have been increasingly provided using the dataas- a-service (DaaS) model, a form of cloud computing services and the core element of data marketplaces. This facilitates the on-the-fly data composition and utilisation for several data- intensive applications in e-science and business domains. However, data offered by DaaS are constrained by several data concerns that, if not automatically being reasoned properly, will lead to a wrong way of using them. In this paper, we support the view that data concerns should be explicitly modelled and specified in data contracts to support concern-aware data selection and utilisation. We perform a detailed analysis of current techniques for data contracts in the cloud. Instead of relying on a specific representation of data contracts, we introduce an abstract model for data contracts that can be used to build different types of data contracts for specific types of data. Based on the abstract model, we propose several techniques for evaluating data contracts that can be integrated into data service selection and composition frameworks. We also illustrate our approach with some real-world scenarios and show how data contracts can be integrated into data agreement exchange services in the cloud."

           "abstract": "Delimiting the distribution of a species is a complex task because many determining factors are difficult to assess in the field. This is important because distribution is a key factor in the decision-making process for conservation. One example is the Bearded Wood Partridge Dendrortyx barbatus, a species endemic to the temperate forests of the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) mountain range in Mexico. Lack of knowledge of its distribution has generated confusion over the assignment of the correct risk category. With the aim of predicting the distribution area of the Bearded Wood Partridge and contributing to strategies for its conservation, we updated and extended the knowledge of its distribution by modelling its ecological niche using GARP and MaxEnt algorithms. We also analysed its environmental distribution using principal components analysis, and contrasted the two most important environmental variables with the species’s distribution based on vegetation type. We found that the area potentially occupied by this species covers 17,956 km2 according to GARP and 12,974 km2 according to MaxEnt. We suggest that there is a biogeographic barrier which limits the distribution of this species in the southern part of its range. The abiotic variables that best explain its distribution are average annual precipitation and elevation, both of which coincide well with the distribution of cloud forest. A redefinition of the current range as recognised by IUCN is proposed along with the need to change its national risk category."

           "abstract": "Expanding visitation to Polar regions combined with climate warming increases the potential for alien species introduction and establishment. We quantified vascular plant propagule pressure associated with different groups of travelers to the high-Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, and evaluated the potential of introduced seeds to germinate under the most favorable average Svalbard soil temperature (10°C). We sampled the footwear of 259 travelers arriving by air to Svalbard during the summer of 2008, recording 1,019 seeds: a mean of 3.9 (±0.8) seeds per traveler. Assuming the seed influx is representative for the whole year, we estimate a yearly seed load of around 270,000 by this vector alone. Seeds of 53 species were identified from 17 families, with Poaceae having both highest diversity and number of seeds. Eight of the families identified are among those most invasive worldwide, while the majority of the species identified were non-native to Svalbard. The number of seeds was highest on footwear that had been used in forested and alpine areas in the 3 months prior to traveling to Svalbard, and increased with the amount of soil affixed to footwear. In total, 26% of the collected seeds germinated under simulated Svalbard conditions. Our results demonstrate high propagule transport through aviation to highly visited cold-climate regions and isolated islands is occurring. Alien species establishment is expected to increase with climate change, particularly in high latitude regions, making the need for regional management considerations a priority."

           "abstract": "The redistribution of life on Earth has emerged as one of the most significant biological responses to anthropogenic climate warming1–3. Despite being one of the most long-standing puzzles in ecology4, we still have little understanding of how temperature sets geographic range boundaries5. Herewe show that marine and terrestrial ectotherms differ in the degree to which they fill their potential latitudinal ranges, as predicted from their thermal tolerance limits. Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and are consequently predicted to expand at their polewardrange boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with climate warming. In contrast, terrestrial ectotherms are excluded from the warmest regions of their latitudinal range; thus, the equatorward, or ‘trailing’ range boundaries, may not shift consistently towards the poles with climate warming. Using global observations of climate- induced range shifts, we test this prediction and show that in the ocean, shifts at both range boundaries have been equally responsive, whereas on land, equatorward range boundaries have lagged in response to climate warming. These results indicate that marine species’ ranges conform more closely to their limits of thermal tolerance, and thus range shifts will be more predictable and coherent. However, on land, warmer range boundaries are not at equilibrium with heat tolerance. Understanding the relative contribution of factors other than temperature in controlling equatorward range limits is critical for predicting distribution changes, with implications for population and community viability."

Location Macaronesia, Mediterranean, Atlantic fringe of Europe. Methods Patterns of genetic diversity are described based on variation at two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) loci and one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus for 109 accessions across the entire distribution range of the species. Global patterns of genetic differentiation were investigated using principal coordinates analysis. Genetic differentiation between island and continental areas, estimations of pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow, and the presence of phylogeographical signal were assessed by means of Fst/NST (continental scale) and Fij/Nij (local scale). Extant and past distribution ranges of the species were inferred from niche modelling using layers describing present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) macroclimatic conditions. Results The Azores exhibited a significantly higher genetic diversity than the continent. The lowest levels of genetic differentiation were observed between the Azores and the western Mediterranean, and the diversity observed in the Azores resulted from at least two colonization waves. Within the Azores, kinship coefficients showed a significant and much steeper decrease with geographical distance in the cpDNA than in the nDNA. The distribution predicted by LGM models was markedly different from the current potential distribution, particularly in western Europe, where no suitable areas were predicted by LGM models, and along the Atlantic coast of the African continent, where LGM models predicted highly suitable climatic conditions. Main conclusions The higher diversity observed in Azorean than in continental populations is inconsistent with MacArthur and Wilson’s equilibrium model and derived theoretical population genetic expectations. This inverted pattern may be the result of extinction on the continent coupled with multiple island colonization events and subsequent allopatric diversification and lineage hybridization in the Azores. The results highlight the role of allopatric diversification in explaining diversification on islands and suggest that this process has played a much more significant role in shaping Azorean biodiversity than previously thought."

           "abstract": "In ecological sciences, the role of metadata (i.e. key information about a dataset) to make existing datasets visible and discoverable has become increasingly important. Within the EU-funded WISER project (Water bodies in Europe: Integrative Systems to assess Ecological status and Recovery), we designed a metadatabase to allow scientists to find the optimal data for their analyses. An online questionnaire helped to collect metadata from the data providers and an online query tool (http://www.wiser.eu/results/meta-database/) facilitated data evaluation. The WISER metadatabase currently holds information on 114 datasets (22 river, 71 lake, 1 general freshwater and 20 coastal/transitional datasets), which also can be accessed by external scientists. We evaluate if generally used metadata standards (e.g. Darwin Core, ISO 19115, CSDGM, EML) are suitable for such specific purposes as WISER and suggest at least the linkage with standard metadata fields. Furthermore, we discuss whether the simple metadata documentation is enough for others to reuse a dataset and why there is still reluctance to publish both metadata and primary research data (i.e. time and financial constraints, misuse of data, abandoning intellectual property rights). We emphasise that metadata publication has major advantages as it makes datasets detectable by other scientists and generally makes a scientist’s work more visible."

           "abstract": "Species distribution models are important tools to explore the effects of future global change on biodiver- sity. Specifically, AquaMaps, Maxent and the Sea Around Us Project algorithm are three approaches that have been applied to predict distributions of marine fishes and invertebrates. They were designed to cope with issues of data quality and quantity common in species distribution modelling, and especially per- tinent to the marine environment. However, the characteristics of model projections for marine species from these different approaches have rarely been compared. Such comparisons provide information about the robustness and uncertainty of the projections, and are thus important for spatial planning and developing management and conservation strategies. Here we apply the three commonly used species distribution modelling methods for commercial fish in the North Sea and North Atlantic, with the aim of drawing comparisons between the approaches. The effect of different assumptions within each approach on the predicted current relative habitat suitability was assessed. Predicted current distributions were tested following data partitioning and selection of pseudoabsences from within a specified distance of occurrence data. As indicated by the test statistics, each modelling method produced plausible predic- tions of relative habitat suitability for each species, with subsequent incorporation of expert knowledge generally improving predictions. However, because of the differences between modelling algorithms, methodologies and patterns of relative suitability, comparing models using test statistics and selecting a ‘best’ model are not recommended. We propose that a multi-model approach should be preferred and a suite of possible predictions considered if biases due to uncertainty in data and model formulation are to be minimised. ©"

A total of 38 palm species were found. The most diverse palm community was in lowland evergreen terra firme forest (28 palm species/4080 palm ind./ha, and seven growth forms), followed by the lower montane forest below 800 m elevation (19 palm species/ 2873 ind./ ha, and four growth forms) and lowland evergreen floodplain forests (17 palm species/3400 palms ind./ha, and five growth forms). The montane evergreen forests above 800 meters elevation (16 palm species/2583 palms ind./ha and three growth forms) and lowland seasonal evergreen and semideciduous forests (seven palm species/1207 palm ind./ha and five different growth forms) were the least diverse communities. Small palms were the most common growth form being represented by 18 (47%) species. Of the 38 palm species altogether, 21 (55%) were solitary, 15 (40%) were cespitose, and two (5%) were colonial. The abundant and dominant palm species, both in the canopy and in the understory, are the same as in other Amazonian forests and shared among several forest types in this study. The high species richness of the lowland evergreen terra firme forest is mostly due to a number of rare species that are lacking in other palm communities. The most abundant palm species were in general species with wide distributions shared among several palm communities suggesting that they are ecological generalists. The montane forests have their own set of palm species, such as Dictyocaryum lamarckianum, Euterpe precatoria var. longevaginata, and Geonoma undata, that separate them from other forest types."

Originally from East Asia, P. hexamera has been recently introduced to North America, apparently through human commerce. Here we document the known range of P. hexamera in Asia and the New World. We compiled and mapped 73 site records of P. hexamera, all from East Asia and the southeastern US. In Asia, P. hexamera records range from 21.9°N to 36.4°N (earliest date and number of sites in parentheses) in Japan (1949; 25), South Korea (1982; 2), and Taiwan (1992; 6). In the US, P. hexamera records range from 28.6°N to 34.3°N: in Florida (1987; 2), Louisiana (1987; 5), Mississippi (2003; 32), and Alabama (2007; 1). Pyramica hexamera is reported for the first time from Alabama."

A total of 479 spiders were collected in Bangtaesan (Mt.), at 128 species of 86 genera in 27 families, and coniferous forest zone or mixed tree forest zone, characterized by the dominance of conifers, displayed higher number of species than decideous forest zone. In terms of family, Linyphiidae included the highest number of species (18 species, 14.1%), followed by Theridiidae (16 species, 12.5%), Araneidae (14 species, 11.0%), Salticidae (13 species, 10.2%) and Tetragnathidae (9 species, 7.0%). Four species, Nesticella mogera of family Nesticidae, Clubiona lena of Clubionidae, Phrurolithus sinicus of Corinnidae and Synagelides zhilcovae of Salticidae, were discovered for the first time in Korean mountains. Zoogeographically, spiders in Bangtaesan (Mt.) displayed 1 cosmopolitan species, with holarctic region and palearctic region species making up 14.1% and endemic species making up 7.8% of the species observed during the study. This shows that spider fauna of Bangtaesan (Mt.) experience northern influence. The result of this study provides an inventory of mountain spiders and information regarding the region's biodiversity, and the results will not only become useful for the effective management and long-term use of national biological resources, but will also become a highly important data for the preservation of biodiversity based on changes in distribution, time and space."

A total of 706 taxa belonging to 128 families, 419 genus, 621 species, 2 subspecies, 71 varieties and 12 forms, were observed. Among those observed, 379 taxa of 89 families were observed in Aphaedo (Is.), 459 taxa of 107 families were observed in Bigeumdo (Is.), and 382 taxa of 101 families were observed in Dochodo (Is.). A total of 6 taxa of plants unique to Korea, including Clematis brachyura Maxim. and Hepatica insularis Nakai were observed. In terms of rare plants as designated by the Forest Service, there were 2 critically endangered species (CR), including Salomonia oblongifolia DC. and Sarcanthus scolopendrifolius Makino, 4 endangered species (EN), including Ophioglossum vulgatum L. and Drosera peltata var. nipponica (Masam.) Ohwi and 13 vulnerable species (VU), including Pyrrosia hastata (Thunb. ex Houtt.) Ching and Euryale ferox Salisb., for a total of 34 taxa. There is an urgent need to protect these taxa, because they are located in areas of high risk of approach by men. In terms of ecologically significant species as designated by the Ministry of Environment, a total of 12 class-V taxa, including Albizia kalkora (Roxb.) Prain and Utricularia vulgaris var. japonica (Makino) Tamura, were observed sporadically. 6 class-IV taxa, including Cladium chinense Nees, were observed, and with the inclusion of class-I, II and III taxa, a total of 124 taxa were confirmed. 75 taxa belonging to 20 families of naturalized plants, which marks 10% of all the taxa observed during the study, were found, and 55 taxa were found in Aphaedo (Is.). It is assessed that there is a need to manage and continuously monitor the expansion of naturalized plants. Among the study sites, the Songgongsan (Mt.) region of Aphaedo (Is.) included a number of wetland plants, including Scleria caricina (R.Br.) Benth. and S. rugosa R.Br., and they are at high risk of damage as a result of continuous interference in the region."

We analysed range-wide genetic diversity (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) in 9581 samples from 1200 populations of 27 northern plant species, to assess genetic consequences of range reduction and potential association with species traits. We used species distribution modelling (SDM, eight techniques, two global circulation models and two emission scenarios) to predict loss of range and genetic diversity by 2080. Loss of genetic diversity varied considerably among species, and this variation could be explained by dispersal adaptation (up to 57%) and by genetic differentiation among populations (F(ST); up to 61%). Herbs lacking adaptations for long-distance dispersal were estimated to lose genetic diversity at higher rate than dwarf shrubs adapted to long-distance dispersal. The expected range reduction in these 27 northern species was larger than reported for temperate plants, and all were predicted to lose genetic diversity according to at least one scenario. SDM combined with F(ST) estimates and/or with species trait information thus allows the prediction of species' vulnerability to climate change, aiding rational prioritization of conservation efforts."

           "abstract": "Specimens of Euproops sp. (Xiphosura, Chelicerata) from the Carboniferous Piesberg quarry near Osnabrück, Germany, represent a relatively complete growth series of 10 stages. Based on this growth sequence, morphological changes throughout the ontogeny can be identified. The major change affects the shape of the epimera of the opisthosoma. In earlier stages, they appear very spine-like, whereas in later stages the bases of these spine-like structures become broader; the broadened bases are then successively drawn out distally. In the most mature stage known, the epimera are of trapezoidal shape and approach each other closely to form a complete flange around the thoracetron (=fused tergites of the opisthosoma). These ontogenetic changes question the taxonomic status of different species of Euproops, as the latter appear to correspond to different stages of the ontogenetic series reconstructed from the Piesberg specimens. This means that supposed separate species could, in fact, represent different growth stages of a single species. It could alternatively indicate that heterochrony (=evolutionary change of developmental timing) plays an important role in the evolution of Xiphosura. We propose a holomorph approach, i.e., reconstructing ontogenetic sequences for fossil and extant species as a sound basis for a taxonomic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary discussion of Xiphosura."

           "abstract": "Over the last two decades, macroecology – the analysis of large-scale, multi-species ecological patterns and processes – has established itself as a major line of biological research. Analyses of statistical links between environmental variables and biotic responses have long and successfully been employed as a main approach, but new developments are due to be uti- lized. Scanning the horizon of macroecology, we identified four challenges that will probably play a major role in the future. We support our claims by examples and bibliographic analyses. 1) Integrating the past into macroecological analyses, e.g. by using paleontological or phylogenetic information or by applying methods from historical biogeography, will sharpen our understanding of the underlying reasons for contemporary patterns. 2) Explicit consideration of the local processes that lead to the observed larger-scale patterns is necessary to understand the fine-grain variability found in nature, and will enable better prediction of future patterns (e.g. under environmental change conditions). 3) Macroecology is dependent on large-scale, high quality data from a broad spectrum of taxa and regions. More available data sources need to be tapped and new, small-grain large-extent data need to be collected. 4) Although macroecology already lead to mainstreaming cutting- edge statistical analysis techniques, we find that more sophisticated methods are needed to account for the biases inherent to sampling at large scale. Bayesian methods may be particularly suitable to address these challenges. To continue the vigor- ous development of the macroecological research agenda, it is time to address these challenges and to avoid becoming too complacent with current achievements."

In many places, exotic populations have invaded and many have become established. Of special concern is the Greater Caribbean Basin, where several exotic populations of Green Iguanas have had a negative impact, and may threaten the conservation of several native species, including possible native and distinct forms of I. iguana in the Lesser Antilles, and the endangered Lesser Antilles Iguana (I. delicatissima Laurenti 1768). We assessed the risk of spread and invasion by Green Iguanas in the Greater Caribbean Basin using the maximum entropy niche-modeling algorithm (MaxEnt) to predict the potential distribution of this reptile. We used a total of 187 location points that represented occurrences from both the native and the invasive range, coupled with environmental data as predictor variables. Our model had average training and test AUC values of 0.90 and 0.87 respectively, indicating a high predictive ability. The model predicts suitable conditions for I. iguana in south and central Florida (mainly along the coast), and in regions of all the islands in the Caribbean. Given the known negative impact of Green Iguanas and their dispersal capabilities, governments in the Greater Caribbean Basin should manage non-native populations to prevent further spread, and revise and enact laws that allow management agencies to respond quickly in the case of new Green Iguana incursions."

Although there are no natural protected areas in Guerrero, it has suitable habitat for the jaguar, a common species used for planning and management of conservation areas. Since, there is actual evidence that environmental and anthropogenic variables may modify vertebrate species distribution with time, in this study we predicted the potential distribution of Panthera onca using MaxEnt for this Southeastern region. In addition, we made a projection considering the effect of a moderate climate change scenario, to evaluate the stability of the conservation area for a period of 24 years. Furthermore, we applied three threat scenarios for the actual prediction to define conservation priorities areas. In our results, we have found that 18 361Km2 (29%) of this state has a permanent suitable habitat for jaguar conservation in the Sierra Madre del Sur and Pacific coast, with a possible loss of 2 000km2 in 24 years. This habitat is characterized by a 56% of temperate forest (mainly conifers and hardwoods 34%), and 35% of tropical deciduous forest. With the projections, the Southeastern region resulted with the higher anthropogenic impacts, while at the same time, an area of 7 900km2 in the Central-Western state was determined as a priority for conservation. To assure jaguar conservation, we propose the inclusion of this new conservation area, which is located in the Sierra Madre del Sur, with which we may potentially preserve other 250 species of threatened vertebrates. This way, the suggested habitat conservation may represent a local effort in Guerrero and will strengthen the biological corridor network for P. onca protection in Latin America."

Mass-digitization can only be completed if the resource-intensive steps, such as specimen selection and databasing of associated information, are minimized. Digitization of larger collections should employ an \"industrial\" approach, using the principles of automation and crowd sourcing, with minimal initial metadata collection including a mandatory persistent identifier. A new workflow for the mass-digitization of natural history museum collections based on these principles, and using SatScan® tray scanning system, is described."

           "abstract": "In most pan-Eurasiatic species complexes, two phenomena have been traditionally considered key processes of their cladogenesis and biogeography. First, it is hypothesized that the origin and development of the Central Asian Deserts generated a biogeographic barrier that fragmented past continuous distributions in Eastern and Western domains. Second, Pleistocene glaciations have been proposed as the main process driving the regional diversification within each of these domains. The European common toad and its closest relatives provide an interesting opportunity to examine the relative contributions of these paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events to the phylogeny and biogeography of a widespread Eurasiatic group. We investigate this issue by applying a multiproxy approach combining information from molecular phylogenies, a multiple correspondence analysis of allozyme data and species distribution models. Our study includes 304 specimens from 164 populations, covering most of the distributional range of the Bufo bufo species complex in the Western Palearctic. The phylogenies (ML and Bayesian analyses) were based on a total of 1988 bp of mitochondrial DNA encompassing three genes (tRNAval, 16S and ND1). A dataset with 173 species of the family Bufonidae was assembled to estimate the separation of the two pan-Eurasiatic species complexes of Bufo and to date the main biogeographic events within the Bufo bufo species complex. The allozyme study included sixteen protein systems, corresponding to 21 presumptive loci. Finally, the distribution models were based on maximum entropy. Our distribution models show that Eastern and Western species complexes are greatly isolated by the Central Asian Deserts, and our dating estimates place this divergence during the Middle Miocene, a moment in which different sources of evidence document a major upturn of the aridification rate of Central Asia. This climate-driven process likely separated the Eastern and Western species. At the level of the Western Palearctic, our dating estimates place most of the deepest phylogenetic structure before the Pleistocene, indicating that Pleistocene glaciations did not have a major role in splitting the major lineages. At a shallow level, the glacial dynamics contributed unevenly to the genetic structuring of populations, with a strong influence in the European-Caucasian populations, and a more relaxed effect in the Iberian populations."

           "abstract": "Aim Species distribution modelling (SDM) has increasingly been used to predict palaeodistributions at regional and global scales in order to understand the response of vegetation to climate change and to estimate palaeodistributions for the testing of biogeographical hypotheses. However, there are many sources of uncertainty in SDM that may restrict the ability of models to hindcast palaeo-distributions and provide a basis for hypothesis testing in molecular phylogenetics and phylogeographical studies. Location Seasonally dry forests (SDFs) in South America. Methods We addressed the problem of using palaeodistribution modelling for SDFs based on the projection of their current distribution into past environments (21 ka) using 11 methods for SDMs and five coupled atmosphere–ocean global circulation models (AOGCMs) for 16 species. Results We observed considerable uncertainty in the hindcasts, with the most important effects for AOGCM (median 12.2%), species (median 15.6%) and their interaction (median 13.6%). The effects of AOGCMs were stronger in the Amazon region, whereas the species effect occurred primarily in the dry areas of central Brazil. The log-linear model detected significant effects of the three sources of variation and their interaction on the classification of each map in supporting alternative hypotheses. An expansion scenario combining the Pleistocene arc and Amazonian expansion, and Pennington's Amazonian expansion alone, were the most frequently supported palaeodistribution scenarios. Main conclusions As a basis for evaluating a given hypothesis, hindcast distributions must be used in direct association with other evidence, such as molecular variation and the fossil record. We propose an alternative framework concerning hypothesis testing that couples SDM and phylogeographical work, in which palaeoclimatic distributions and other sources of information, such as the pollen fossil record and coalescence modelling, must be weighted equally."

This condition is, however, violated when autocorrelation is present within the data. In the case of variables that are regularly sampled in space (i.e. lattice data or images), such as those provided by remote-sensing or geographical databases, this problem is particularly acute. Because analytic derivation of the null probability distribution of the test statistic (e.g. Pearson's r) is not always possible when autocorrelation is present, we propose instead the use of a Monte Carlo simulation with surrogate data."

           "abstract": "Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and C4 photosynthetic syndromes have much in common: they employ a shared biochemical pathway that enables the concentration of CO2 inside plant cells, they are both considered to be adaptations to stressful environments, and they are both arguably among the most convergent of complex traits, having each evolved multiple times in various plant lineages. They are also both signature elements of stress-adapted floras the world over and play fundamental roles in the ecological success of flowering plants. In spite of these similarities, the obvious phenotypic and ecological differences between certain groups of fully optimized C4 and CAM plants have led us to generally view these syndromes as very distinct ecological adaptations. A broad look at the distribution of CAM and C4 plants across a very large phylogeny of angiosperms highlights that while CAM photosynthesis seems to have evolved more often, both CAM and C4 origins show tight and overlapping clustering in many regions of the tree, suggesting that certain plant lineages are prone to evolve either pathway. Additionally, recent phylogenetic analyses revealed that the origins and diversification of many CAM and C4 lineages were recent and contemporaneous in time. We postulate that the evolutionary “starting points” for CAM and C4 pathways could be much more similar than typically acknowledged. Using species with C3-C4 and CAM-like intermediate phenotypes as models of CAM and C4 evolution has been productive, but the distinct advantages that each affords may have promoted rapid ecological divergence that subsequently masked any shared ancestral characteristics between the two pathways. Focusing on newly discovered phylogenetic “hotbeds” of CAM and C4 evolution will allow for inclusion of relevant C3 taxa and a finer evaluation of the possible environmental and organismal traits that would strongly favor the evolution of one syndrome over the other."

           "abstract": "Aim To test a method for rapidly and reliably collecting species distribution and abundance data over large tropical areas [known as Neotropical Biodiversity Mapping Initiative (NeoMaps)], explicitly seeking to improve cost- and time-efficiencies over existing methods (i.e. museum collections, literature), while strengthening local capacity for data collection. Location Venezuela. Methods We placed a grid over Venezuela (0.5 × 0.5 degree cells) and applied a stratified sampling design to select a minimum set of 25 cells spanning environmental and biogeographical variation. We implemented standardized field sampling protocols for birds, butterflies and dung beetles, along transects on environmental gradients (‘gradsects’). We compared species richness estimates from our field surveys at national, bioregional and cell scales to those calculated from data compiled from museum collections and the literature. We estimated the variance in richness, composition, relative abundance and diversity between gradsects that could be explained by environmental and biogeographical variables. We also estimated total survey effort and cost. Results In one field season, we covered 8% of the country and recorded 66% of all known Venezuelan dung beetles, 52% of Pierid butterflies and 37% of birds. Environmental variables explained 27–60% of variation in richness for all groups and 13–43% of variation in abundance and diversity in dung beetles and birds. Bioregional and environmental variables explained 43–58% of the variation in the dissimilarity matrix between transects for all groups. Main conclusions NeoMaps provides reliable estimates of richness, composition and relative abundance, required for rigorous monitoring and spatial prediction. NeoMaps requires a substantial investment, but is highly efficient, achieving survey goals for each group with 1-month fieldwork and about US$ 1–8 per km2. Future work should focus on other advantages of this type of survey, including the ability to monitor the changes in relative abundance and turnover in species composition, and thus overall diversity patterns."

           "abstract": "The orophilous plant, Ranunculus parnassiifolius L., is a polyploid complex that is widespread throughout the southern European mountains, where at least five taxa have traditionally been recognized. The aim of this study was to test whether R. parnassiifolius subsp. cabrerensis should be treated as an independent species of the R. parnassiifolius polyploid complex and constitutes, therefore, an evolutionary line in itself. To disentangle its evolutionary history and taxonomy, we used genome size estimation based on flow cytometric measurements (FCM), multivariate morphometric analyses, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR–RFLPs) and subsequent sequencing of cpDNA regions (trnS, trnR-atpA, atpH-atpI). This study provides molecular and morphological evidence for the recognition of R. cabrerensis at the species level, rather than as an intraspecific taxon of R. parnassiifolius. Furthermore, it is concluded that those plants previously known as R. parnassiifolius subsp. muniellensis should be systematized at the subspecies level as R. cabrerensis subsp. muniellensis. This contribution highlights the benefit of combining diverse approaches to obtain knowledge about relict populations and for the implementation of suitable conservation measures."

The core idea of the schema is to delimit descriptions of taxa, or treatments, within an article and also several sub-elements within a treatment, and to use these individual portions of information for various purposes. TaxPub was developed in a close cooperation between the author (Terence Catapano), a community interested in such markup (Plazi), the NLM JATS group and a journal publisher (Pensoft). Since July 2009, TaxPub has been routinely implemented in the everyday publishing practice of Pensoft, to provide: (1) Semantically enhanced, domain-specific XML versions of articles for archiving in PubMedCentral (PMC); (2) Visualization of taxon treatments on PMC; (3) Export of taxon treatments to various aggregators, such as Encyclopedia of Life, Plazi Treatment Repository, and the Wiki Species-ID.net."

GEO BON focusses on coordination and harmonisation of the existing and emerging systems; advocacy and action to sustain the observing systems and to fill the identified gaps; and understanding and servicing user needs for biodiversity observations, particularly in the policy-making domain."

Here, we present an overview of the Brazilian Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (BACAP), which is still being developed by Brazilian herpetologists. Basic research ¢ particularly species inventories, taxonomic revisions and the collection of field data ¢ are urgently needed to guide amphibian conservation in the country. Documentation and monitoring of amphibian richness has improved, at least at regional scales. Lists of threatened species are regularly updated, efforts to standardize field work protocols are being attempted and captive breeding is being considered as a research and educational tool. We also present a short history of the BACAP, identify some of the challenges tied to its implementation, and review a few but important recent achievements."

           "abstract": "1. It has been proposed that, across broad spatial scales, climatic factors are the main drivers of ecological patterns, while biotic factors are mainly important at local spatial scales. However, few tests of the effect of biotic interactions on broad-scale patterns have been conducted; conclusions about the scale-dependence of the importance of biotic interactions thus seem premature. 2. We developed an extensive database of locality records of one of Africa’s most conspicuous groups, the acacias (the genera Senegalia and Vachellia), and used species distribution models (SDMs) to estimate the distribution of all African acacias. 3. African acacias are particularly well adapted against mammalian herbivory; therefore, we hypothesized that browser diversity could be an important driver of acacia richness. Species richness maps for the two genera were created from SDM-generated maps. Ordinary least square (OLS) regressions and, to consider spatial autocorrelation, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) analyses were used to model richness of the two genera in relation to mammalian browser richness, current environment (including climate), and climate history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We used variation partitioning to determine what percentage of variation could be explained by these three groups of factors. 4. Both genera showed centres of richness in East Africa and the Limpopo Basin of southern Africa. Browser richness was the best explanatory variable for richness of both genera. Environmental factors explained negligible variation in the richness of Senegalia, but some variation in Vachellia. For both genera, the residuals of the species richness model of one genus also explained much variation in the richness of the other genus, indicating that common factors not considered in the richness analyses here may additionally be driving the richness of both genera. 5. Mechanisms that could generate a correlation between browser and acacia richness are proposed, and differences in the determinants of richness patterns of Senegalia and Vachellia discussed in the light of the two genera’s history of colonization of Africa. 6. Synthesis. This is the first study that demonstrates that consumer diversity can influence richness patterns at continental scales and demonstrates that biotic factors can drive richness even at broad spatial scales."

           "abstract": "Realizing the importance of a data collection and dissemination network, the Environmental Information Division of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India, in December, 1982, established the Environmental Information System (ENVIS), as a plan programme. Since its inception, the focus of ENVIS has been on providing environmental information to decision makers, policy planners, researchers, etc. across the country. As the environment is a broad-ranging, multi- disciplinary subject, a comprehensive information system would necessarily involve effective participation of concerned institutions/organizations in the country that are actively engaged in work relating to different subject areas of the environment. ENVIS has therefore developed by forming a network of such participating institutions/organizations to make the programme meaningful. The Focal Point of the present 66 ENVIS centres in India is at the Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi. The ENVIS Centre at the BNHS has been assigned the responsibility for information on Avian Ecology. Through this document we would like to share our experience of data discovery and information dissemination services provided by ENVIS Centres. Having experience of more than 15 years, we feel that a lot can be done to improve such systems."

           "abstract": "Species in the ivesioid clade of Potentilla (Rosaceae) are endemic to western North America, an area that underwent widespread aridification during the global temperature decrease following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. Several morphological features interpreted as adaptations to drought are found in the clade, and many species occupy extremely dry habitats. Recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the sister group of this clade is Potentilla section Rivales, a group with distinct moist habitat preferences. This has led to the hypothesis that the ivesioids (genera Ivesia, Horkelia and Horkeliella) diversified in response to the late Tertiary aridification of western North America. We used phyloclimatic modeling and a fossil-calibrated dated phylogeny of the family Rosaceae to investigate the evolution of the ivesioid clade. We have combined occurrence- and climate data from extant species, and used ancestral state reconstruction to model past climate preferences. These models have been projected into paleo-climatic scenarios in order to identify areas where the ivesioids may have occurred. Our analysis suggests a split between the ivesioids and Potentilla sect. Rivales around Late Oligocene/Early Miocene (∼23 million years ago, Ma), and that the ivesioids then diversified at a time when summer drought started to appear in the region. The clade is inferred to have originated on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains from where a westward range expansion to the Sierra Nevada and the coast of California took place between ∼12-2 Ma. Our results support the idea that climatic changes in southwestern North America have played an important role in the evolution of the local flora, by means of in situ adaptation followed by diversification."

           "abstract": "Marine invertebrates inhabiting the high Antarctic continental shelves are challenged by disturbance of the seafloor by grounded ice, low but stable water temperatures and variable food availability in response to seasonal sea-ice cover. Though a high diversity of life has successfully adapted to such conditions, it is generally agreed that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the large-scale cover of the Southern Ocean by multi-annual sea ice and the advance of the continental ice sheets across the shelf faced life with conditions, exceeding those seen today by an order of magnitude. Conditions prevailing at the LGM may have therefore acted as a bottleneck event to both the ecology as well as genetic diversity of today's fauna. Here, we use for the first time specific Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for marine arthropods of the Southern Ocean to assess effects of habitat contraction during the LGM on the three most common benthic caridean shrimp species that exhibit a strong depth zonation on the Antarctic continental shelf. While the shallow-water species Chorismus antarcticus and Notocrangon antarcticus were limited to a drastically reduced habitat during the LGM, the deep-water shrimp Nematocarcinus lanceopes found refuge in the Southern Ocean deep sea. The modeling results are in accordance with genetic diversity patterns available for C. antarcticus and N. lanceopes and support the hypothesis that habitat contraction at the LGM resulted in a loss of genetic diversity in shallow water benthos."

However, due to scarcity of myxomycete research in this country and the importance of inventories involving microorganisms for such purposes as restoration ecology and ecosystem functioning projects, the data presented herein represent a necessary contribution to an understudied aspect of tropical ecology"

           "abstract": "Polyploidization plays an important role in species formation as chromosome doubling results in strong reproductive isolation between derivative and parental taxa. In this note I describe a new species, Mimulus peregrinus (Phrymaceae), which represents the first recorded instance of a new British polyploid species of Mimulus (2n = 6x = 92) that has arisen since the introduction of this genus into the United Kingdom in the 1800’s. M. peregrinus presents floral and vegetative characteristics intermediate between M. guttatus and M. luteus, but can be distinguished from all naturalized British Mimulus species and hybrids based on a com- bination of reproductive and vegetative traits. M. peregrinus displays high pollen and seed fertility as well as traits usually associated with genome doubling such as increased pollen and stomata size. Te intermediate characteristics of M. peregrinus between M. guttatus (2n = 2x = 28) and M. luteus (2n = 4x = 60-62), and its close affinity with the highly sterile, triploid (2n = 3x = 44-45) hybrid taxon M. × robertsii (M. guttatus × M. luteus), suggests that M. peregrinus may constitute an example of recent allopolyploid speciation."

The morphology of this monotypic genus (Talpidae, Eulipotyphla, Mammalia) indicates that it should fall into the tribe Scalopini. Although all the other scalopines are distributed in North America, S. oweni is endemic to Central and Southwest China. Previous studies have indicated that the chromosomes of talpid moles exhibit remarkable stability. However, the karyotype of S. oweni has not been determined. In this study, we report the karyotypes including G-banding and C-banding patterns of S. oweni. The diploid and fundamental autosomal numbers are 34 and 64, respectively, identical with six other talpid species and thus providing another line of evidence for chromosomal uniformity in this family. The models of karyotype stability are discussed, none of which adequately explains the chromosomal conservatism. We suggest that comprehensive approaches are needed to test in which degree that the chromosomal rearrangement, phylogeny, phylogeography and ecological adaptation have shaped the chromosomal evolution in this family."

           "abstract": "This chapter shows how a synthesis of heterogeneous biological field observation data, robust taxonomic methods, and data mining leads to up-to-date scientific information that is important for sustainability and conservation management. The core of this type of research is a database with field observations. Here we use the Himalayan Uplands Plant Database (HUP), which consists of extensive collections of botanic survey information collected by the senior author in the Himalayas and in renowned public herbaria over more than 25 years. The HUP database is primarily based on preserved herbarium specimens and presently holds more than 164,000 occurrence records of vascular plants. It contains the records of more than 2,000 collectors and observers who had either directly or indirectly contributed, or records that were derived from herbarium label information. Consistent taxonomic information and the sound use of taxonomy is the key to success of any exercise with large amounts of heterogeneous biological collection data. Taxonomy, especially on the scales of developing consistent cross-border registries, still comprises one of the most obvious bottlenecks to our understanding of biodiversity. In the absence of consistent backbone taxonomies, physical documentation (collecting, preserving, and curating of good and representative herbarium specimens or other vouchers), and quality control must be stressed as necessary preconditions to vegetation and ecology-related studies. Although inherent synonymy rates are obviously quite variable among different taxonomic groups, there is no logical, automated, or permanent procedure that could identify or constrain synonyms. A wide range of Floras, monographs, taxonomic treatments, original publications, and databases has been consulted in HUP to identify and verify specimens, and to develop, at least internally, consistent taxonomies. Other challenges of using such a large collection are the long time span covered and the diversity and inconsistency of spatial and altitudinal information. Thus, large parts of the data are currently not covered by current georeferencing databases such as BioGeomancer or by international taxonomic databases such as ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). The history of modern biodiversity exploration is brief—in the Himalayas, a mere 200 years—whereas dramatic ecological change and disturbance including deforestation, land degradation, melting glaciers, and increasing severity of natural hazards occurred during the periods of collection. Historic data are thus precious not only on account of the “priority principle” in biological taxonomy. To ensure the highest level of usage of such precious data, we regard the availability of the data for similar and potentially even larger exercises as critically important. Here we show that a new culture needs to develop and mature for sharing, exploiting, and improving primary biodiversity data and for taxonomic work in progress. The example of HUP is used to give a step-by-step best practice guidance to make biological data digitally available online using existing and rapidly developing data-sharing infrastructures. The information of the database columns was transferred into the Darwin Core 2 format and uploaded to the publicly accessible Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; www.gbif.org). Through GBIF it is also available using the Mountain Biodiversity Portal (MBP; www.mountain biodiversity.org), which allows to query, filter, and download GBIF data specific for mountain areas, with a horizontal (region) and vertical (elevation, climate) dimension and includes many options. In addition, a first-version XML-metadata information was created and uploaded to the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) metadata clearinghouse (National Biological Information Infrastructure 2010; http://metadata.nbii.gov/clearinghouse). Thus, the HUP data are made accessible worldwide either by searching for metadata in the NBII clearinghouse database and through the authors, by searching for original biological data at GBIF, or by searching for mountain-specific information at the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) mountain biodiversity portal."

           "abstract": "Aim With climate change, reliable predictions of future species geographic distributions are becoming increasingly important for the design of appropriate conservation measures. Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to predict geographic range shifts in response to climate change. However, because species communities are likely to change with the climate, accounting for biotic interactions is imperative. A shortcoming of introducing biotic interactions in SDMs is the assumption that biotic interactions remain the same under changing climatic factors, which is disputable. We explore the performance of SDMs while including biotic interactions. Location Fennoscandia, Europe. Methods We investigate the appropriateness of the inclusion of biotic factors (predator pressure and prey availability) in assessing the future distribution of the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) in Fennoscandia by means of SDM, using the algorithm MaxEnt. Results Our results show that the inclusion of biotic interactions enhanced the accuracy of SDMs to predict the current arctic fox distribution, and we argue that the accuracy of future predictions might also be enhanced. While the range of the arctic fox is predicted to have decreased by 43% in 2080 because of temperature- related variables, projected increases in predator pressure and reduced prey availability are predicted to constrain the potential future geographic range of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia 13% more. Main conclusions The results indicate that, provided one has a good knowledge of past changes and a clear understanding of interactions in the community involved, the inclusion of biotic interactions in modelling future geographic ranges of species increases the predictive power of such models. This likely has far-reaching impacts upon the design and implementation of possible conservation and management plans. Control of competing predators and supplementary feeding are suggested as necessary management actions to preserve the Fennoscandian arctic fox population in the face of climate change."

           "abstract": "Climate-induced changes in the distribution of species are likely to affect the functioning and diversity of marine ecosystems. Therefore, in economic and ecological important areas, such as the English Channel, projections of the future distributions of key species under changing environmental conditions are urgently needed. Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have been applied successfully to determine potential distributions of species based on the information of the environmental niche of a species (sensu Hutchinson). In this study, the niches of two commercially exploited benthic species, Pecten maximus and Glycymeris glycymeris, and two ecologically important species, Abra alba and Ophelia borealis were derived using four contemporary hydrographic variables, i.e. sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, water depth and sediment type. Consequently, using these ecological envelopes, the Non- Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche model (NPPEN) was applied to calculate contemporary probabilities of occurrence for each species in the North East Atlantic and to predict potential re-distributions under the climate change scenario A2 for two time periods 2050e2059 and 2090e2099. Results show general northern displacements of the four benthic species from the English Channel into the North Sea and Southern Norwegian coast. The projections mostly indicate a reduction of suitable habitat for benthic species with a notable disappearance of their distributions in the English Channel, except for A. alba. However, interpretations should be treated with caution since many uncertainties and assumptions are attached to ecological niche models in general. Furthermore, opening up potential habitats for benthic species does not necessarily imply that the species will actually occupy these sites in the future. The displacement and colonisation success of species are a function of many other nonclimatic factors such as species life histories, dispersal abilities, adaptability and community interactions."

It is possible to convert textual, paper-printed checklists into structured digital formats. This process can eventually lead to the development of digital information systems, for which the output can be far more complex than a list of taxa. Digital information systems can be continuously updated by a constant flow of information, and their content can be exported in many other different formats, hence not only mobilising, but also making biodiversity data reusable on different platforms. The conversion of the Checklist of Italian Lichens into an information system is discussed, in order to provide some general guidelines of such a process."

           "abstract": "In this study, we report new data on the biodiversity and the geographic and bathymetric distribution of bryozoans collected during the ANT XXI/2 cruise (November 2003 to January 2004) in the Eastern Weddell Sea and Bouvet Island, and during the Spanish Antarctic expedition ECOQUIM (January 2006) in the South Shetland Islands. Our data on distribution were analysed together with previous studies carried out in the same regions. A total of 54 species of Antarctic bryozoans (206 samples), including a new species of the genus Reteporella were found. Two species were reported for the first time from Bouvet Island, one from the Weddell Sea and one from Spiess Seamount. Fifty-five per cent of all species identified were endemic to Antarctica. In the Weddell Sea, the regions of Austasen and Kapp Norvegia exhibit the highest relative species richness, followed by the Vestkapp region. Multivariate and cluster analyses revealed small-scale spatial variability in the community structure along depth and between localities."

           "abstract": "The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a native species from eastern North America that was introduced to Ecuador in 1985. We built two models in Maxent, (1) one model with native records and, (2) one model with native and invasive records, to provide an approximate map of the potential geographical distribution for this species in Ecuador. Both models showed significant differences in the prediction of suitable areas, model 2 being the most consistent in relation to occurrence records. Here, we present the invasive potential of the American bullfrog to occupy a wide variety of environments such as Amazonia, if human activities lead to an accidental or induced introduction. Furthermore, this study is the first survey about the distribution of the American bullfrog in Ecuador, thus identifying some susceptible areas where conservation efforts should be focused to prevent new settlements and uncontrolled breeding of this species."
