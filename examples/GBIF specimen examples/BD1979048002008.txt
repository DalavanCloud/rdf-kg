(Pisces, Siluriformes, Loricariide)

Abstract
Three new
species belonging to two different genera of South
American mailed catfishes of the subfamily Loricariinae are
described and figured. A discussion of and comparative notes
on related species are added.
Rineloricaria formosa n. sp. is described from the Río
Inírida/Río Orinoco drainage in Colombia, from the Río
Atabapo (Río Orinoco drainage) in Venezuela, and from the
Rio Tiquié and Rio Uaupés (Rio Amazonas drainage) in
Brazil. It is compared with Rineloricaria morrowi Fowler,
1940, with Rineloricaria melini (Schindler, 1959), and with
Rineloricaria fallax (Steindachner, 1915). The lectotype of
the latter species is herein designated, and a discussion on
the
misidentification of R. fallax with Loricariichthys brunneus
(Hancock, 1828) is added.
Rineloricaria hasemani n.
sp.
is based on three specimens,
two of which are paralectotypes
of Rineloricaria fallax from
Maguarý. The specimens were collected from streams around
Belém, Est. Pará, Brazil. This new species seems more closely
related to Rineloricaria stewarti (C. H. Eigenmann, 1909)
than to R. fallax.
Loricariichthys platymetopon n. sp. is based
upon
several
specimens found in the Río Paraná/Río Paraguay system and
in the Rio Uruguay, and
upon one specimen collected from
near the Rio Solimões. This species has hitherto erroneously
been recorded as Loricaria maculata by Valenciennes (1840,
1847) and by Boulenger (1896), as Loricariichthys maculatus
by Lüling (1975), and as Loricaria typus (in subgenus Lori-
cariichthys) by Regan (1904) and by A. de Miranda Ribeiro
(1918). It seems likely that previous records of these nominal
species (particularly from the Paraná/Paraguay basin) actually
concern, at least in
part, L. platymetopon. This is confirmed
for two specimens from the Rio Uruguay. L. platymetopon
is compared with Loricariichthys maculatus (Bloch, 1794) --
of which Parahemiodon typus Bleeker, 1862, provisionally is
considered a junior synonym -- and with Loricariichthys
ucayalensis Regan, 1913, the lectotype of which is herein
designated from the two syntypes.

INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGE-
MENTS
The present publication forms
part of a series of
studies of the taxa within the subfamily Lori-
cariinae. The methods
employed to
prepare
the
descriptions are the same as in our 1978 publica-
tion, except
for the term "odontode", which sub-
stitutes the term "dermal denticle" as
previously
used
(see 0rvig, 1977).
Several colleagues have been helpful in sending specimens
in their care on loan, as an exchange, or as a gift. We would
like to express our
great appreciation for this cooperation to
the following persons:
Mrs.
J. Abel (MNHN), Mr. E.
Ahlander (NRS), Mrs. Dr. M. L. Bauchot (MNHN), Dr. M.

developed preanal plate, preceded by three com-
paratively large polygonal scutes. Anterior to these
scutes are five to six smaller polygonal scutes in a
curved transverse series, reaching the
posterior
thoracic scute. All these elements
may together
form an inflexible plate, although in some of the
specimens the scutes in transverse series allow some
movement. This
posterior complex is
preceded by:
(2) A flexible median
complex, consisting of
small polygonal scutes
reaching the ventral edges
of the thoracic scutes. There are three median series
of four to six scutes in
longitudinal rows.
(3) An anterior inflexible complex of still smaller,
polygonal scutelets in front of the median complex.
This immovable plate is more or
less rounded
anteriorly and reaches to the height of a ventral
extension of the dermal ossification of the head
margin, at its broadest
part.
The head has ventrally an almost uninterrupted
marginal dermal ossification with a more or less
triangular extension anterior to the branchiostegal
membrane. The tip of the snout has a short, narrow
naked horizontal area. All dermal ossifications --
including scutes, fin spines, and
rays --
are covered
with minute, acute dermal denticles, the odontodes.
Ridges covered with somewhat more prominent
odontodes are -- as usual throughout the members
of the genus Rineloricaria --
present in two
longi-
tudinal rows along the coalescing and parallel
lateral body scutes. In addition, a longitudinal
series of very low ridges is visible on six scutes
situated between the lateral and the dorsal scutes,
the first of which is at the
height of the origin of
the dorsal fin
spine. Two
quite prominent, pos-
teriorly strongly diverging ridges are
present on
the supraoccipital process,
and a
pair of
ridges is
Rineloricaria formosaFig. 1. n.
sp., holotype in dorsal, lateral, and ventral view.

present on the predorsal scutes between the
supra-
occipital process
and the large median predorsal
plate. Dorsal snout
margin and supraorbital edges
slightly raised; anterior region of predorsal scutes
and
posterior region of supraoccipital process some-
what
depressed. Tip of supraoccipital process
round.
A
conspicuous posterior orbital notch is
present
A
pectoral pore
is not found. There are simple
pores
of the sensory canal system on the dorsum of
head and snout, and bifurcated
pores
between the
ridges along the
coalescing and parallel lateral
body scutes and in a naked area dorsal to the first
two
coalescing scutes.
The shape and structure of the lips are the same
as
in the related species of Rineloricaria: Upper lip
very narrow, naked dorsally, the edge with short,
rounded papillae. Lower
lip ventrally with numer-
ous distinct, isolated papillae, largest and most
numerous towards buccal cavity; surface between
these
larger papillae covered with minute papillae.
Lower lip slightly to distinctly notched medially.
A short rictal barbel is present between
upper
and
lower
lips, covered with papillae. No
fleshy flaps
or
prominent papillae are found in the buccal
cavity.
Teeth in
upper jaws somewhat smaller than
teeth in lower jaws. The shape of the teeth is the
same in both
upper
and lower jaws, with a smaller,
acute outer lobe and a
larger inner lobe. The inner
lobe
may
have an acute or slightly roundish tip:
mostly these are the larger teeth near the medial
side of the
jaw; more
usually the inner tip has a
rather narrow base, broadening anteriorly, with a
frontally oblique edge (fig. 3).

Colour in alcohol
(figs. 1-2). -- Ground colour
of ossified parts yellowish tan and of naked parts
whitish.
Dorsum of body posterior to the dorsal fin base
with five to six
regularly distributed transverse
brown stripes, the anterior
stripe is the broadest,
the three stripes posterior to it
gradually narrower,
whereas the two (or one) posterior to these may
be rather obsolete. Dorsum of body and head from
tip of snout to base of caudal fin with numerous
minute and small brown spots of irregular shape,
mostly roundish. These
spots are visible as darker
brown
markings on the transverse
stripes.
The
spots beyond the first transverse stripe tend to be
larger than those in front of this
stripe. Base of
second dorsal fin ray with a rather dark brown,
small roundish
spot.
Even brown pigmentation is
visible between the
ridges on the supraoccipital
process.
This dark pigmentation is often sur-
rounded
by a narrow unpigmented ring (fig. 2),
particularly in
specimens smaller than 125 mm
(besides the
specimens represented in table III, the
largest topotype has a
si of only 88.3 mm). Some
specimens show a faint
spot
in front of the dorsal
fin
spine, the same as the characteristic predorsal
spot of Rineloricaria fallax.
Pores on
dorsum of snout and head black.
Dorsal fin
spine and rays, and dorsum of pec-
toral fin with faint, irregular greyish brown small
dots.
Tips of first two branched dorsal fin
rays
usually with diffuse tan
pigmentation. The anal
fin
spine and the outer half of the
rays may show
some small brownish
spots.
Pelvic fin
spine
with
brownish
pigmentation, sometimes forming small
spots.
Caudal fin base with dark brown
pigmentation
on and
just about the triangular scutelet, and on the
small dorsal and ventral caudal scutelets. Caudal
fin membrane dark brown pigmented. The rays
are
alternately spotted with brown and
tan,
forming either a chess-board pattern, or
irregular
vertical lines.
Upper caudal fin
spine usually with
brown and
yellowish spots.
The ten
paratypes
in FMNH 83715 and in
ZMA 114.923 are
generally darker than the 28
other Colombian
specimens. They tend to have
an additional, rather faint
stripe on the dorsum of
the
body (not unlike the, much
stronger developed,
stripe present in the holotype of Rineloricaria mor-
rowi, see
discussion
below), commencing at the
spot at the base of the second dorsal fin
ray,
obliquely running forward to the dorsal ridge
along the coalescing scutes.
Etymology. --
The
specific name formosa (Latin)
means beautiful and alludes to the whole fish.
Discussion. -- Rineloricaria formosa appears on
the one hand most closely related to Rineloricaria
morrowi Fowler, 1940 and Rineloricaria melini
(Schindler, 1959) on
the basis of their very similar
morphology, especially that of the rounded snout
with slightly raised dorsal margin, and the distri-
bution and
development of the odontodes, and on
the other hand to Rineloricaria fallax (Steindach-
ner, 1915) because of the
presence
of a predorsal
spot.
Rineloricaria morrowi was
originally described
from the holotype (and still
only known specimen,
ANSP 68663), collected at Contamana (07°19'S
75°04'W), Ucayali River basin, Peru (fig. 6).
The morphometric and meristic data of this speci-
men are
given in tables lb and Illf, showing the
differences with R. formosa
in relative dimensions
of predorsal length, postdorsal length, postanal

length, anal spine length, pelvic spine length, snout
length, head
depth, and depth and width of caudal
peduncle.
Although the hoiotype of Rineloricaria morrowi
has a somewhat faded pigmentation, the differen-
ces in colour pattern between this
species and R.
Formosa are still evident. In R. morrowi there are
minute, obscure brownish
spots on the dorsum of
head and body, less
prominent than in R.
formosa.
Posterior to the dorsal fin base five conspicuous,
transverse, rather broad, solid dark brown
stripes
are
present;
in addition, a
sixth transverse stripe
(far less conspicuous than the other stripes) is
present on
the dorsum of the body, running ob-
liquely forward from the first to the third branched
dorsal fin
ray;
at the base of these rays a dark
brown
spot is visible. The
spots on
dorsal and anal
fins are similar to those in R. Formosa, whereas
the dorsum of the pectoral fin
hardly has any
spots.
The caudal fin has a colour pattern re-
sembling that of R. Formosa, but has a more plain
central
portion with small, light and indeterminate
spots, the distal ends of the branched
rays being
provided with dark brown
pigment forming a
vertical stripe along the
margin. The base of the
fin, including the caudal scutes, is dark brown just
like the anterior third of the
upper
and lower
branched rays.
Pelvic fin
plain. Ventral part of the
body devoid of pigmentation, except
for some
small dark brown
marginal concentrations posterior
to the 19th lateral body scute. The tip of the
supraoccipital process
is somewhat darker than the
surrounding predorsal region. We should add that
this is not
clearly visible: a concentration of dark
brown
pigment has not been noted
by Fowler
(1940: 244-246, figs. 39-41). Fowler (loc. cit.)
originally used the variant (erroneous) spelling
of Rhineloricaria, which he
subsequently corrected
(Fowler, 1954: 118-119, references).
Rineloricaria melini was originally described as
Loricariichthys melini
by Schindler (1959: 387-
389). It is known only from the
holotype (NRS
10830), collected near Manacapuru (03°l6'S
60°37'W), Rio Solimoes
(= Rio Amazonas),
Est. Amazonas, Brazil (fig. 6). Isbriicker &
Nijs-
sen
(1976a: 112) listed this species as Rineloricaria
melini. We have examined the
holotype, of which
the morphometric and meristic data are given in
tables Ic and
Illg, showing the differences with
R.
formosa in relative dimensions of predorsal
length, postdorsal length, postanal length, snout
length, abdominal length, interorbital width, head
depth, body depth at dorsal, body width at dorsal
and anal, and
depth of caudal peduncle. R. melini
has in
longitudinal lateral series one scute less than
R. formosa.
The colour
pattern
of Rineloricaria melini re-
sembles that of R. formosa. R. melini has some
transverse dark brown stripes on the dorsum of the
body, but these are
quite irregular and hard to
distinguish from the large, irregular dark brown
blotches also
present on
the dorsum of the
body.
There is a
very narrow, incomplete transverse stripe
on the 18th, one stripe on
the 19th, one on the

22nd, and one on
the 28th lateral body scute.
The spots and blotches on the dorsum of head and
body are much more prominent than in both R.
Formosa and R. morrowi, those on the head
forming at least four transverse, narrow, rather
irregularly defined stripes. A conspicuous though
small, dark brown
spot
is
present at the base of
the first branched dorsal fin
ray.
Caudal fin dam-
aged, but
showing traces of a colour
pattern
resembling that of R. morrowi rather than that of
R. formosa. Colour
pattern
of pectoral and dorsal
fins as
in R. Formosa, pelvic and anal fins without
pigmentation.
The small but often conspicuous dark
spot
between the
ridges on
the
supraoccipital process
in
R. formosa, R. morrowi and R. melini --
which is
almost
always surrounded
by a narrow unpig-
mented
ring in the freshly preserved specimens of
R. formosa --
is reminiscent of a characteristic
pattern found in Rineloricaria fallax (Steindach-
ner, 1915). In this
species, there is a conspicuous
dark brown
spot
in front of the dorsal fin. This
spot is surrounded
by a narrow, unpigmented
ring, which is
laterally bordered with a dark
brown, partly roundish line extending sometimes
anteriorly as far as the
tip of the
supraoccipital
process.
In few specimens this colour mark is rather
faint.
In a subsequent paper we
will redescribe and
illustrate Rineloricaria fallax. We take the
oppor-
tunity to discuss here some
taxonomic
problems
concerning this species and Loricariichthys brun-
neus
(Hancock, 1828),
with which Rineloricaria
fallax has been often confused.

Type-material examined. ---
Rineloricaria fallax (Steindachner, 1915):
Lectotype (by present designation): NMW 44864, si
144.7 mm, male, Brazil, Est. Roraima, Igarape de Carauna
(= Sa. Grande, 02°35'N 60°45'W) near B6a Vista (02°51'N
60 O/
f3'W), altitude 200 m above sea level, Rio Branco
drainage, Rio Amazonas basin, coll. J. D. Haseman, about
4-XII-1912.
Paralectotypes: Except for the specimens from Ru-
pununi River, all paralectotypes conspecific with the lectotype
originate
from
Brazil, Est. Roralma, upper
Rio Branco drain-
age;
all were
collected by J. D. Haseman, 1912/1913: ZMA
114.349 (ex NMW 46158, two), si 104.5 mm, Igarape de
Capivary [locality not traced], probably between Rio Parime
and Rio Surumu, III/IV-1913; NMW 46159 (one), si 79-1
mm, Rio Branco near Bern Querer [locality not traced, but
it is near Caracarai, 01°47'N 61°H'W}, 1912; NMW 44868,
posterior caudal peduncle somewhat malformed, "si" 138.5
mm, male, Rio Branco near 02°10'N 60°55'W,
XII-1912; NMW 44867 (one), si 133.2 mm, ZSM 4869
(ex NMW), si 140.8 mm, male, NMW 45046, si 157.2 mm,
male, Rio Branco near Boa Vista, 02°51'N 60°43'W, 1912/
1913.
NMW 46157 (one), si 134.1 mm, male, and NMW 44866,
si 80.1
mm, southern Guyana near Brazilian frontier (Rio
Branco territory), Rupununi River, 11-1913.
Rineloricaria platyura (Miiller & Troschel, in Schomburgk,
1848):
NMW 44869 (paralectotype of Loricaria (Loricariichthys)
fallax), si 112 mm, Brazil, Est. Para, Maguary [locality not
traced] along the Bragan?a railroad [Braganga, 01°02'S
46°46'W], in forest streams which
empty into Rio Guama
[Guama, 01°35'S 47°29'W], 29-VII-1913 (see table IVc).
We have also examined the holotype of this species (ZMB
3166, si 108.4 mm, from Guyana, Rupununi River (fig. 6),
coll. R.
Schomburgk; see tables Ie and IHi), as well as the
holotype of Loricaria submarginatus C. H. Eigenmann, 1909
(FMNH 53080, ex CM
1570, si 85.1 mm, Guyana, creek
below Potaro Landing, Essequibo River system (fig. 6), coll. E.
Shideler; see tables If and Illj). L. submarginatus was rightly
considered a junior synonym
of R. platyura by C. H. Eigen-
mann (1912: 248-249, in key on
p. 245, as Loricariichthys
(Rineloricaria) platyurus, pi. XXX fig. 4, pil. XXXI fig.
3). The three specimens agree perfectly in colour pattern.
The specimen in NMW 44869 differs from the holotypes
mentioned in the following morphometric characters: si, axial
length, hi, predorsal length, postdorsal length, postanal length,
dorsal spine length, first dorsal ray, anal spine length, pelvic
spine length, maximum orbital diameter, interorbital width,
head depth, depth caudal peduncle, and rictal barbel. More
specimens are needed to assess the taxonomic significance of
these apparently slight differences.
Rineloricaria hasemani n.
sp.:
NMW 44865 and ZSM 19732 are paralectotypes of Loricaria
(Loricariichthys) fallax. See description below.
The references to Rineloricaria fallax may prove
to concern a polyspecific group
after all specimens
mentioned have been re-examined and compared
(particularly some of the Peruvian material re-
corded
by C. H.
Eigenmann & Allen, 1942). None
of these records, however, seems to include
speci-
mens belonging to the
genus Loricariichthys, but
rather to the
genus
Rineloricaria sensu lato (in-
cluding Hemiloricaria Bleeker, 1862). This was
already suggested by C. H.
Eigenmann (1912: 245,
in
key), who
regarded Rineloricaria a
subgenus of
Loricariichthys.
Steindachner (1915: 101) included Loricaria
stewarti
(or Loricariichthys stewarti, also a Rine-
loricaria sensu lato) and an illustration of Lori-
cariichthys brunneus sensu C. H.
Eigenmann, 1912,
as doubtful synonyms
of his new
species. It is in-
teresting to note that two of the numerous
syntypes
of Loricaria
( Loricariichthys) fallax, although
greatly resembling Rineloricaria stewarti, in fact
represent a new species, described below as Rine-
loricaria hasemani, whereas another syntype
is
closely related to
(and perhaps identical with)
Rineloricaria platyura (Miiller & Troschel, in
Schomburgk, 1848). These three
syntypes are in-
dicated to be from Maguary near Para, a locality
remote from the type-localities of both R. platyura
and R. stewarti (Rupununi River, Essequibo River
system, Guyana, and Chipoo Creek, a tributary of
the Rio
Ireng, upper
Rio Branco drainage, Rio
Amazonas system, Guyana/Brazil, Est. Roraima,
respectively; see fig. 6).
Steindachner (1915) unfortunately did not state
BIJDRAGEN TOT DE DIERKUNDE, 48
(2) -
1979 199
the number of specimens he had available for his
original description, and omitted at least some
locality records
(e.g. from the lectotype; we suspect
that this
specimen was with the artist who illus-
trated it while Steindachner made his
description).
Dr. P. Kahsbauer
kindly put at our disposal an
unpublished, typewritten report entitled: "The
general account of a fishing expedition to north-
eastern South America, 1912-1913" by J. D. Hase-
man (24 pages,
of which
p.
3 is missing). Hase-
man collected most of the
specimens described
by Steindachner (1915), including all his Loricaria
fallax. Haseman (op. cit.: 19) wrote: "I
planned
to leave Serra do Mel early April 14
[1913], but
the pack animals could not be found until quite
late; however we travelled to the end of Serra do
Banco before night. We
slept there and started at
sunrise of the
following day so that we would
get
out of the hot basin between Serra do Banco and
Serra de Panelao before noon. Along the
way we
caught a queer bearded Loricaria, which was
prob-
ably a male of L. brunneus, in a puddle of a
dried
up
stream
flowing to Rio Parime." Un-
fortunately, we did not succeed in finding this
specimen among
the rich NMW material
during
visits to the collections of the Naturhistorisches
Museum, Vienna. We have examined the syntypes
listed above (and designated the lectotype; second

Rineloricaria fallax is a rather common
species.
In most museum collections, specimens have been
misidentified as
Loricaria brunnea or as Loricariich-
thys brunneus. In the list of paralectotypes above,
numbers in
parentheses following the
register
numbers refer to additional specimens of the same
sample retained in NMW, which were not ex-
amined in detail. The other
paralectotypes have
been examined together at one
time. The
specimens
from Boa Vista are
considered as paralectotypes.
Notwithstanding the fact that Boa Vista was not
included in Steindachner's series of syntype-locali-
ties, these specimens were collected
by J. D. Hase-
man
along with several others in the Rio Branco
drainage. All were initially identified -- either by
Haseman or by Steindachner -- as Loricaria.
(Lori-
cariichthys) brunnea
prior to the establishment of
Rineloricaria fallax. Parts of the material that evi-
dently represent syntypes were still labeled as L.
brunnea in the Vienna collection. However, no
specimens from "...dem Rio Parime bei Serra do
Banco...," were found with a label accordingly
written.

Hancock's Loricaria brunnea is a poorly described species.
Subsequent material attributed to this species does not
possess
any of the few characters described, and so is referred to
Rineloricaria fallax (see above). The holotype of Loricaria
brunnea is apparently lost: an extensive search has been made
in the collections of BMNH. Hancock (1828: 240) sent his
collection of Demerara animals to the Zoological Society,
London, from where they were subsequently transferred to
BMNH. Possibly the holotype of Loricaria brunnea (from the
Orinoco River) was not amongst this material, and the
original description may well have been based on a specimen
that was not preserved. On the basis of certain characters
mentioned in the original description, we ascribe Loricaria
brunnea to the
genus Loricariichthys, as it might well prove
to be
closely related to (or even
identical with) Loricariichthys
acutus (Valenciennes, in Cuvier & Valenciennes, 1840), over
which it has priority. It should be added that the holotype
of Loricariichthys acutus is also lost. Only if brown Lori-
cariichthys specimens from the Orinoco River, reaching a
(total or standard) length of 10 to 12 inches (254 to 304.8
mm) and with a single row of abdominal scutes will become
available, the problem of the identity of Loricaria brunnea
can
be solved.
C. H. Eigenmann & E. S. Eigenmann (1889: 37) were
unable to identify Loricaria brunnea with any
of the sub-
genera they recognized within Loricaria. In their key of 1890
(: 362) L. brunnea is placed into the subgenus Rineloricaria,
but evidently this was done inadvertently, as is clear from the
separation of the couplets e and ee.
Rineloricaria fallax, with which Loricariichthys brunneus
has been often confused, is not known to occur in the Orinoco
River drainage.

Description. --
Morphometric and meristic data are
presented in
tables Ha and Illl-n, and are not repeated here.
In
many
of its morphological characters, Rine-
loricaria hasemani is similar to R.
Formosa de-
scribed above, although it seems more closely
related to R. stewarti. It differs from R. Formosa
in the
following characters:
Ridges on supra-
occipital process diverge less strongly. Tip of
supra-
occipital process
broad and flat. Odontodes some-
what more prominent, especially on
the dorsum
of the head and anterior part of the body, where
they are arranged into fine wavy lines. Teeth
almost exactly as in R. Formosa, except
for the
shape of the
tips, having an acute or slightly
roundish lanceolate form
(fig. sa).
Colour in alcohol (fig. 4). --
Ground colour of
ossified parts brownish tan, dorsal
part
of head and
body darker than ventral
part; unossified
parts
whitish.
Dorsum of body with five rather ill-defined,
transverse brown
stripes, each with several minute
dark brown
spots. The first
stripe originates at the
base of the first to second or
third branched dorsal
fin
ray
and extends oblique anteriorly, reaching
to the dorsal edge of the thoracic scutes. The second
stripe is
quite broad
(extending over two trans-
verse dorsal
scutes) and is situated somewhat

Pores
on dorsum of head almost black, dark brown.
Ventral
part
of the body with a dark, tan to brown-
ish, longitudinal streak, originating posterior to the
end of the inner
pectoral fin ray, extending to the
base of the caudal fin.
Ridges on
coalescing and
lateral
body scutes mostly unpigmented.
Dorsal fin
spine and
rays
with some small,
irregularly arranged brownish
spots, especially
near the
tip of the rays.
A more
prominent spot
occurs at and near the
tip of the first or the first

fay
and
adjacent membrane. Dorsum
of pectoral and
pelvic fins rather dark, sometimes
with some
inconspicuous brownish spots. Anal fin
hyaline with or almost without small brownish
stains.
Base of caudal fin brown; upper
and lower
"spine" with regular small dark brown
spots; tips
of caudal fin
rays
and
adjacent membrane pig-
mented with dark brown, forming a solid stripe
along the outer
margin.
Etymology. -- Rineloricaria hasemani is named
after J. D. Haseman, who assembled perfectly pre-
served collections of South American freshwater
fishes in the
early 1900's, including the specimens
on which this species is based.
Discussion. --- Rineloricaria hasemani
appears
to
have close affinities with Rineloricaria stewarti
(C. H.
Eigenmann, 1909). We have examined the
holotype of this
species (FMNH 53330, ex
CM
1508, si 57.3 mm, from Guyana, Chipoo Creek
(fig. 6), a
tributary of the Rio Ireng between
Karakara
[not traced] and the
Rupununi River
[cf. C. H.
Eigenmann, 1912:
3], coll. W.
Grant),
the morphometric and meristic data of which are
given in tables lib and IIIo.
Rineloricaria hasemani and R. stewarti have al-
most identical colour
patterns. R. stewarti has no
longitudinal ventral streaks, and fewer
spots on
the dorsal fin
rays
than R. hasemani. R. stewarti
has very distinct strigilae (in the present case this
does not
appear
to be a
juvenile character) on
dorsal and dorsolateral scutes, lacking in the much
smoother R. hasemani. Since R. stewarti is known
from small specimens only, we are not sure
whether
it is a "dwarf"
species or not. Boeseman (1976:
167-168, pis. VI & VII, table 4, fig. 2, in
key on
p. 156) records 57 specimens as Loricaria (Lori-
cariichthys) cf. stewarti from 16 Surinam samples.
His
largest specimen, indicated in
pi. VI as a
female, is
only 104 mm in si. In his key he notes:
"...males with
enlarged spines on interorbital and
occipital areas." Our
specimens of Rineloricaria
hasemani do not show these secondary sexually
dimorphic characters.
The holotype of Rineloricaria stewarti has teeth
(fig. 5 b) which are reminiscent of those in R.
formosa in
shape, but not of those in R. hasemani.
If the holotype of R. stewarti only represents some
juvenile stage,
several morphometric differences
found between this
species and R. hasemani (see
table III) are
likely to
disappear when larger speci-
mens of the former become known. There are
many
differences to be noted: in standard length (and

NEW MAILED CATFISHES204
(1) The posterior complex consists of a well-
developed anal
plate, anteriorly bordered by a
small number of rather
large, polygonal scutes
which, together with the posterior thoracic scute,
form a large, inflexible preanal plate. The anal and
preanal plates are a fused continuation of the
laterally movable ventral scutes of the caudal
pe-
duncle.
(2) The middle complex has, together with the
well-developed adjoining thoracic scutes, a func-
tion in
allowing up
and down movements of the
head; these movements are
possible only because
of the
presence
of this
complex and the movable
scutes anterior to the origin of the dorsal fin spine
and
posterior to the
supraoccipital process.
Principally three midventral transverse "series"
of scutes are
present
anterior to the preanal plate.
Usually the
posterior scute is
single, whereas the
two series anterior to this scute consist of two or
three
parts irregularly fused somewhere in the
middle.
(3) The anterior complex of scutes reaches to
about the height of the
origin of the last pectoral
fin
ray.
It is a quite firm, inflexible, anteriorly
rounded
plate, consisting
of smaller polygonal
scutes, decreasing in size
anteriorly.
A
comparatively large, triangular plate is
present
anterior to the branchiostegal membrane. It is an
isolated extension of the ventrally ossified head
margin. All dermal ossifications including scutes,
fin
spines, and rays are covered with numerous
minute odontodes
giving a quite smooth
appear-
ance.
Contrary to the condition found in Rine-
loricaria heteroptera Isbriicker &
Nijssen, 1976,
these odontodes are not sexually dimorphic. The
odontodes are prominently larger in two rows
along the coalescing and
parallel lateral body
scutes.
A
conspicuous orbital notch is
present, its dorsal
margin is rounded posteriorly.
Anteriorly the head has a rather broad, naked
margin which narrows towards the
opercular
region, reaching to about the height of the posterior
point of the orbital notch.
A minute pectoral pore
is
present just ventral
to the posteroventral tip of the cleithrum. There
are
simple pores
of the
sensory canal system on the
dorsum of the head and snout, and on the ventrally
ossified snout
margin, and bifurcate pores
between
the two rows of prominent odontodes along the
lateral body scutes. Those pores between the
coalescing scutes are situated just below the
pos-
terior
edges of the dorsal row.
Secondary sexually dimorphic characters are
found as differences in structure and
pigmentation
of the lips (compare fig. 7, a male, with fig. 8,
a female), and in
shape of the teeth.
In the female, the dorsal side of the upper lip
consists of smooth skin
extending from the ventral
tip of the snout to just anterior of the
upper jaws,
then running laterally along part
of the rictal bar-
bels, its
edge becoming papillate with about ten
to
eighteen subbarbels. The ventral side of the
upper lip is covered with numerous weakly de-
veloped soft striae, and
ridges of papillae; larger
papillae are situated near the subbarbels just men-
tioned. The
edges on either side of the
upper jaw
are almost separated from each other by a small,
triangular flap of skin
originating just anterior to
the symphysis of the
upper jaws. On the ventral
surface of this flap there is a medial ridge of skin,
running to a point between the right and left
upper jaws.
The
upper
and lower lips are connected with
each other by rictal barbels, together forming a
sort of sucking device. The lower lip consists of
two thick, cushion-like
parts --
thickest towards
the buccal
cavity -- with a median separation
bridged by thin skin. This surface is covered
anteriorly with rather inconspicuous soft striae
and ridges of weak papillae, increasing in size
towards its
edge. A more or less prominent median
notch
may
be
present. The edge of the lower
lip
has small
triangular papillae and minute
flaps.
In mature males the lower lip and posterior
part of the
upper lip become gradually longer and
broader, to form a huge labial velum. During this
process
the two cushion-like structures
present in
females and
juveniles disappear completely. This
labial velum has an
important function in the
protection of
eggs (and possibly of larval stages).
A male in ZMA 110.929 with a
si of 186 mm
has
a lower lip length of 36.3 mm and, measured
between the points where the rictal barbels project
from the lips, a width of about 53 mm.
In the buccal
cavity, posterior to the
upper jaws
BIJDRAGEN TOT DE DIERKUNDE, 48
(2) -
1979 205
are two narrow transverse
flaps of skin with
roundish outer
edges, connected in the middle.
The outer surface of these flaps is
provided with a
number of
elongate axial ridges and flat
papillae.
Inconspicuous bilobed teeth (inner lobe
larger
than outer lobe) are
present
in both
upper
and
lower jaws; they are about equal in length in both
jaws; however, the outer teeth are somewhat smal-
ler than the inner ones.
In females and
juveniles
the tips of the teeth are slender and acute, in
nuptial males the
tips become much broader and
rounded.
Tip of
supraoccipital process
rather acute.
Eye with a narrow dorsal covering of blackish
and
silvery pigmented skin, the iris
partly covered
by a small, rounded or triangular dorsal flap.

Ground colour of
dorsum of the fish
(up to ventral row of prominent

often has a somewhat darker dorsal part.
Juveniles. Seven of the
paratypes (two
in BMNH
1927.11.23:38-40, five in BMNH
1928.1.6:1-5)
range from 73.5 to 90.3 mm si. Even the smallest
specimen has the abdominal scutes completely
developed. Because of some morphometric dif-
ferences (e.g., their narrower interorbital, clearly
an allometric feature in this
species), these small
specimens are
termed
juveniles, also because of the
following peculiarities. The posterior orbital notch
is
distinctly weaker developed and lacks the
characteristic
shape which gradually develops with
age. Sensory pores
show
up more clearly, especially
along the dorsal snout
margin and the
ventrally
ossified snout
margin, causing a more coarse
ap-
pearance
of these parts than found in
larger speci-
mens. The colour pattern in these small
specimens
is not
pronounced, at least in preserved state.
Etymology. --
The specific name
platymetopon
is from the Greek rcAa-rui; meaning broad, and
from the Greek
[XSTWTCOV meaning forehead, an
allusion to the broad interorbital area, which is
diagnostic for this

Loricariichthys platymetopon has
been described under various names,
at least since
1840: Valenciennes's
description of Loricaria ma-
culata was based on a
specimen we
designate as a
paratype
of Loricariichthys platymetopon, just like
the
specimen recorded as Loricaria maculata from
Paraguay by Boulenger (1896). The latter

NEW MAILED CATFISHES208
men was subsequently identified as Loricaria
typus
(within the
subgenus Loricariichthys) by Regan
(1904). Only some of the
specimens recorded er-
roneously as Loricariichthys maculatus by Luling
(1975) are identified with
certainty as Loricariich-
thys platymetopon, being the
only specimens of
his numerous samples we were able to examine.
Recently, the
holotype of Parahemiodon typus
Bleeker, 1862
(RMNH 3121; type-species of the
genus Parahemiodon Bleeker, 1862) was received
on loan (cf. Isbriicker & Nijssen, 1976b: 110).
It has been compared directly with the
lectotype
of Loricaria maculata Bloch, 1794 (ZMB 3163;
type-species of the
genus Loricariichthys Bleeker,
1862). Most of the few differences between these
two specimens (see tables Ild-e, and
Vl-n) seem
to lie within the range of phenotypic variation, and
indicate that Parahemiodon
typus
should be con-
sidered a junior synonym
of Loricariichthys macu-
latus. This would confirm the
opinion expressed
by Van der
Stigchel (1946 & 1947: 172-174) on
this part
of his
synonymy
of Loricaria maculata,
supported by Boeseman's recent
(1976: 160-165)
account on Loricaria (Loricariichthys) maculata,
in which he includes a re-examination of the holo-
type of Parahemiodon typus. However, there is one
character in which this holotype differs from other,
comparable, Surinam
specimens: its wide inter-
orbital (according to column S in table 2 of
Boeseman, 1976: 162, it is 4.15 in hi
against 4.30
to 5.25 in 30 other specimens). It is not
surprising
that
Loricariichthys platymetopon has sometimes
been identified as Parahemiodon typus. Most
rep-
resentatives of the genus Loricariichthys have a
much narrower interorbital. Bleeker (1864, pi.
XIII fig. 1) published an illustration of the
pre-
dorsal region of the
holotype of Parahemiodon
typus, showing the interorbital area slightly broad-
er (about 3-8 in head length, agreeing with some
of the paratypes
of L. platymetopon with a com-
parable si) than is actually the case (4.1 in hi, same
as in the
lectotype of Loricariichthys ucayalensis
Regan, 1913).
Loricariichthys maculatus has been recorded
from several localities, including specimens origi-
nating from localities where L. platymetopon
were found; the same holds true for records of
Parahemiodon typus. At least some of these sped-
mens
might prove to be conspecific with our new
species. We
suspect
that most records of Para-
hemiodon typus from at least the Rio Parana
system actually represent Loricariichthys platy-
metopon. For
example, in
Ringuelet et al. the
species keying out (1967: 405) as Loricaria (Lori-
cariichthys) typus is
probably identical with L.
platymetopon. However, several different species
of
Loricariichthys occur in the Rio Parana and
Rio Paraguay system, and we prefer to examine
all this material before assigning the various and
numerous references to
any synonymy.
The occurrence of Loricariichthys platymetopon
in Venezuela seems likely because of records of
L.
typus (e.g., Machado Allison &
Lopez Rojas,
1975: 93-119). These authors published an excel-
lent account on
developmental stages of a
Lori-
cariichthys they identified as L.
typus, originating
from "...cerca de Camaguan [08°09'N 67°37'W],
puerto
sobre el rio Portuguesa, Estado Guarico,
Venezuela.", Orinoco River
drainage. It would
be
necessary
to
compare all their material (as well
as specimens previously identified from Venezuela
as
typus
and maculatus, e.g., by Pellegrin, 1899:
158, Rio
Apure; Schultz, 1949: 77, Caripito; Fow-
ler, 1954: 104-105; and by Mago Leccia, 1970:
85) before it can be satisfactorily assigned to
any
species.
Loricariichthys platymetopon appears
to be
closely related to Loricariichthys ucayalensis Regan,
1913, which itself is closely related to Loricariich-
thys maculatus (Bloch, 1794) (including Para-
hemiodon typus). L.
ucayalensis was
originally
described from two
syntypes, both nuptial males.
We herewith designate the larger as the lectotype
(BMNH 1913.7.30:36, si 198 mm). The only
paralectotype (BMNH 1913.7.30:37) is 171 mm
in si (tables Ilf, Vo-p). L.
ucayalensis and L.
maculatus
eventually might prove
to deserve dis-
tinction at subspecific rather than at specific level,
or even may have to be regarded not distinct at
all. L. platymetopon differs from both L.
ucaya-
lensis and L. maculatus mainly in three characters:
it attains a larger standard length (up to 299 mm
against 198 and 212.5 mm for L.
ucayalensis and
L. maculatus, respectively), it has a more
strikingly
spotted colour pattern than both L.
ucayalensis and
L. maculatus, and it is characterized by a broader
BIJDRAGEN TOT DE DIERKUNDE, 48 (2) -
1979 209
interorbital than found in
any
other Loricariichthys
species, including L.
ucayalensis and L. maculatus.
To avoid a
lengthy technical discussion, the re-
lation of standard
length and interorbital width as
a ratio of head length is shown in
fig. 9- As can
be seen in this
figure, the interorbital of smaller
specimens is
usually narrower than that of adults.
Amongst all
Loricariichthys specimens we have
measured thus far, only four specimens have a
rather broad interorbital, approaching that of L.
platymetopon: one is the lectotype of L. ucayalen-
sis, another is the holotype of Parahemiodon typus,
whereas the last two are
syntypes of Loricariichthys
anus (Valenciennes, in Cuvier & Valenciennes,
1840).
Several specimens, including primary type-
material of 14 of the 17 species described in the
genus Loricariichthys (cf. Isbriicker &
Nijssen,
1976b: 110), were available for comparison with
L. platymetopon. This material will form the basis
for a revision of the
genus and in this revision
this material will be fully indicated.
Vaillant (1880: 157 &
158) refers Loricaria
maculata (non Bloch, 1794) sensu Valenciennes
(in d'Orbigny, 1847, pi. VI fig. 3 "...et les deux
figures au trait non numerotees.") to the
synonymy
of his Loricaria valenciennesii. Obviously, Vaillant
did not re-examine Valenciennes's
specimen, which
undoubtedly is a Loricariichthys platymetopon,
whereas Loricaria valenciennesii is a junior syn-
onym
of Rineloricaria teffeana (Steindachner,
1878).
