    "abstract": "The genera Haplotmarus Simon, 1909 and Indoxysticus gen. nov., two enigmatic genera of crab spiders from the Oriental region (Araneae: Thomisidae). - The genus Haplotmarus Simon, 1909 has never been studied since its original description 100 years ago. In this paper, the type species H. plumatilis Simon, 1909 is redescribed and a provisional diagnosis for the genus is provided. A new genus, Indoxysticus gen. nov., type species Xysticus minutus Tikader, 1960, is proposed and diagnosed. Haplotmarus is distinguished by the following characters: prosoma and opisthosoma with numerous long setae, opisthosoma with dark patches in two parallel rows, epigynum with a copulatory chamber and a duct leading to multi-chambered spermathecae. lndoxysticus minutus females can be identified by their distinct oval spermathecae with well-defined chambers, males by their very distinct palp with a broad-based embolus."
