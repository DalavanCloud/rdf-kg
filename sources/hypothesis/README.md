# Annotation

Use hypothesis to annotate web pages, PDFs, etc.

If annotating PDF try and link to "work"

Same for web page (should be easier via DOI in HTML <meta>

Annotating BHL, treat BHL page as document, has URI (URL for PageID), link back to containing document

Can we get a vocablary term for a "page", do we need one?

## Annotation linked to page

A name found on a page (e.g., current BHL) could be represented like this:

![anno1](https://github.com/rdmpage/rdf-kg/raw/master/sources/hypothesis/annotation.png)

So oa:hasTarget points directly to the BHL page. For this annotation we donâ€™t know where name occurs on page, simply tat it does.
