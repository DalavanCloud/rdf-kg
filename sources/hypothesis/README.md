# Annotation

Use hypothesis to annotate web pages, PDFs, etc.

If annotating PDF try and link to "work"

Same for web page (should be easier via DOI in HTML <meta>

Annotating BHL, treat BHL page as document, has URI (URL for PageID), link back to containing document

Can we get a vocablary term for a "page", do we need one?
