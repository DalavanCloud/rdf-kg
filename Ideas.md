# Ideas


## Icons

Some tools have very clear visiaul feedback, such as GBIF (upload data get a map), and altmetric (donut). This gives user a sense that something has happened, and that there's now something which didn't exist before. Data connections are a bit abstract, can we have a visualisation that is simple but which shows these connections? Maybe a bit like Withings clover leaf pattern?




## Questions we can ask with triple store


### Can we match GenBank, BOLD,and GBIF records

### Can we then generate list of citing papers from those linked to sequences

For each sequence that we link to a voucher, link voucher to paper that published sequence

### Sequences linked to tyes

### Papers publishing new name will cite types, implicitly or explicitly

For each type specimen, find name, find in BioNames/IPNI/etc., make link between specimen and literature

# Extending geography

Based on Elsvier challenge idea, extend geography of papers/ specimens by linking to sequence that are georeferenced


### Citation graph

### Can we dedup and cluster authors

Develop tools to infer authorh identify based on coauthorship patterns
